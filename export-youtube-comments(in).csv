@alucardxx142,Just got one and I love it
@charityworks.studio,"Wow, thanks for this video! So informative! I've used Pentel brush pen and quite comfortable with it. So glad you made a comparison. Perhaps add link to the 'refilling Pentel brush pen' video? (I'll search it.) Thanks again!"

@debsmith7050,Good to know :)   Thanks for your review
@edoverde,"Hello, what ink did you use to fill?"
@higherground711,Excellent review and tips as always. ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ Thanks Teoh.
@hindside,"Hi Teoh, as a first brush pen would you recommend this or the Pentel? Iâ€™ve watched your reviews and canâ€™t decide what to get my daughter. Thank you"
@jeffm3283,I accidentally destroyed my vermillion Kuretake pen because there were no English instructions.  So thanks for the video
@karolus28,4:43 this is the moment I realised that you were actually making a drawing
@kathybrenneman1868,"The parts are in the pen for a reason. The sponge helps to regulate the ink flow. Why take it all apart? 
Anyway.... Thanks for sharing.  Your faithful follower.

@kimbarsegyan,"Is it ok to use the Rotring Isograph ink with the brush pen, or are there any better options?"
@lindyashford7744,Really like the markmaking quality of this brushpen. I wonder whether I can get it in the uk. Thanks for showing how it can be refilled.
@mnz9214,Hi again ^_^ i just bought a pilot metropolitan. Do you have a video on it?
@MrSpani11,hey :) which kind of paper do you use?
@Nunyabeeswax777,This was an impressive brush pen.
@OneTrueWord1988,"This looks like a very nice pen! I am, however, a natural-born spiller, and I can just picture the mess I could create with pliers and black ink!  ðŸ˜„"
@richardmika2136,hard to control the marks  better off wih crayola marker
@rumi1403,"2nd comment! hi teoh, i hope you have a nice day. great video btw!ðŸ™‚"
@selfsameday7448,Great for bamboo drawing
@sheripatson5787,"This brush has lots of versitality I would enjoy it"" your sketches always nice"
@steveshillitoe2971,Thank you for this very helpful video.  I was given a Kuretake Cambio brush pen as a Birthday present & I was wondering how to refill it.  Now I know how to!
@timeconstrained2400,Great close-ups. Is this the medium or large model?
@Walking-MY-Path,"I have a Pentel Brushpen and this looks similar but at the same time it doesn't. The bristles are wider and the body is solid instead of soft and squeezable. Thanks for this review Teoh. I remember watching your videos, when your channel only had like 20K subs. Now look how far you've come and still going strong!!"
@WendiWells,"I think this is my new favorite brush  pen!! Thank you for reviewing this and taking it apart, etc. Do you know how much bigger the brush tip on this pen is compared to a large Kurtake water brush? For years Iâ€™ve wished they would make an extra large water brush!"
