@ivanpavez7378;I hesitated so much to buy this fountain pen But so far it's the best pen I've bought  the Pilot Vanishing Point.;0;2025-04-01T00:53:10Z
@dymetex6360;the fact that i can't fill it completely kinda drives me a little crazy  BUT i love my matte black VP and always inbk it with Iroshizuku Yama Budo;0;2025-03-26T02:29:04Z
@sofiamelo8980;How about cleaning the front part of the penâ€¦? Thanks â¤;0;2025-03-06T17:52:34Z

@brianrose340;My VP has issues with ink leakage that builds up around the internal nib housing and eventually out around the clip. Can you think of why that is happening and if thereâ€™s anything I can do about it?;1;2025-01-26T03:09:45Z

@JefferyHall-ct2tr;Hi Brian!  Thanks for the informative video!  Lots of good info here!  Have a great weekend!;1;2025-01-24T14:04:00Z
@seanbrown3512;Thanks Brian  another great video!! I love my VP! On the subject of pilot  any idea when you will restock Iroshizuku Rikka and Syun-gyo?;1;2025-01-24T05:10:07Z
@NecroKitten;Also - if anyone's ever lost their little silver nubbin' for the cartridges/end of the cartridges - if you contact Pilot  they should send you one! I'm in Canada and just had to pay shipping  they sent me a new one easy peasy without questions. :);1;2025-01-23T21:15:40Z
@ivanupton6586;I wish more Pen Brands with Proprietary cartridge/converter styles would do what Majohn does and make empty cartridges with stoppers...;1;2025-01-23T19:54:02Z
@grulice;Ordered my matte black VP with an F nib in November. The nib is rotated clockwise approx 5-10 deg with respect to the clip. It also wrote really dry  until I got it tuned up at a stationery shop  now it writes like a dream. That rotation drives me absolutely nuts every time I look at the pen though ?Ÿ˜¢;2;2025-01-23T12:25:37Z

@tomlevasseur8550;Itâ€™s been 30 years since I bought a new fountain pen  but my red and gold vanishing point will be here on Friday followed by my Verdigris Pilot custom 743 which should arrive on Saturday along with paper and many ink samples from Goulet Pens.;1;2025-01-23T05:55:49Z

@hivona;Vanishing point had been on my wish list for a few months and I got my first one Dec 31st! Now Iâ€™m addicted! I bought 3 more in January ?Ÿ˜® but I am not very proficient at filling them so this video is right on time!;2;2025-01-23T03:34:01Z
@agent0422;"Your ""capillary action"" explanation  which you've mentioned in other videos too  has been extremely helpful for me now that I've started writing with a fountain pen.

@maryannehommel103;Great video for someone new to the VP! I love my VP  and my Decimo. I tend to refill my cartridges rather than use the con-40  and I'm happy to see Iroshizuku available in cartridges.;1;2025-01-23T02:59:33Z
@adnansalim2187;"Despite all qualities Pilots have very poor suction power across the line. The only technique I learned to maximise ink suction

@mumalogue;Whenever I fill up my CON-40 the same way with the fill-empty-fill-empty cycle  I wonder if I am contaminating the ink bottle in the same way that weâ€™re not supposed to empty old ink from converter into the bottle.. totally academic question as the only other option I see is to syringe fill;0;2025-01-22T22:42:11Z
@AlanDayley;Thanks for the review. I had forgotten about the cartridge cover. Good thing my VP has been working fine with out it. Now  it is installed.;2;2025-01-22T22:16:14Z
@JustinBakerDeDav;I still remember someone came to me looking for help with a VP saying it was stuck.  Turns out they just jammed the nib unit back into place unaligned and at quite the angle...  Wasn't able to close it much less click and use it.  Pain.;0;2025-01-22T21:58:39Z
@James-cn5qe;I wondered if the capless wasn't designed to just use a cart and the converter was designed later. The con 40 is pretty n useless.;0;2025-01-22T21:22:36Z

@ForTheLoveOfPens;Great straight-to-the-point video! Personally I like eye-droppering cartridges on this because itâ€™s hard to see the ink level with the CON 40. Same for the E95s model as well.;10;2025-01-22T21:15:50Z

@beandrake6383;The pilot falcon became my go to pen for illustration. The extra fine nib works well for scientific illustration. It also has enough line variance to adjust to different art styles. It is also so smooth!;;
@Davy-oq9pn;"""entry level "" is really an abused term at this point. I have an L2K (stainless steel version) and a Pilot VP and they are amazing pens and at a great price. Still if we're talking entry level then you can get a Parker 45 with a more vintage 14k gold alloy nib that has a decent amount for flex for like $30 on ebay. Using the term entry-level for over $100 pens when there are significantly cheaper pens that fit the bill is just kinda goofy IMO. We all know these are pens for enthusiasts.";;

@saurabhchanda653;HI. I live in India  and cannot afford the nice 150 dollar plus pens. I use a Lamy CP1. It is my daily writer and I just want to know if I can change the nib to a gold one?

@Alfa-iz9bw;I got the Pilot vanishing point decimo  and u said that  the grip on the pen is really bad and some people hated it  but for me  I had no problem with that. The reason people hated the pen was the grip and what kind of handgrip there is.;;

@AbdullahArRafi;I'm using the Pilot VP as my daily driver  and damn it feels so great! The fine nib has a touch of feedback which I like because it doesn't give a 'pencil' feel but more like a premium writing experience. I've narrowed down my choice to a few pens  so which one do you suggest to get among these: Sailor Pro Gear  Pilot 823  Pilot E95s  and Lamy 2000 purely based on the writing performance? I guess I wouldn't mind having glass-smooth nibs. However  I truly enjoy what Pilot does with its nibs!;;
@Ziretech;Got the platinum century 3776 blue with EF nib. I take notes in my A6 Leuchtturm1917 dotted notebooks and it is absolutely perfect! Loves the stiffness and feedback of the nib!;;

@rafgomez333;Thank you very much for the video  Brian. And have you tried any of the gold nib pens from Marlen?

@wittwittwer1043;"I have one or more each of the pens reviewed. Least favorite: Lamy 2000  because the grip section is too narrow & tapered. Most preferred: Namiki/Pilot Falcon  because it has the best nib response of any of the others.

@alexczar1456;No mention of Sailors even though they're half the price of these fives. Feels more like an add for the product that is carried by the Goulet Shop. Which is ok  but I feel that one should be open about it.;;
@AustinSteingrube;"I'm a little surprised you included the Custom 74 in your list. My significant other picked one up a couple months ago and after seeing your mention  I decided to try it out. With Noodler's Apache Orange in both the 74 and the $15 Metropolitan for comparison  we found the two wrote almost identically. The 74 was just as stiff  rough writing  and had the same flex as the $15 Metro... 

Thinking I was insane (after all  a gold nib is  well  a gold nib)  I picked up my Lamy Al-Star and tried it on the same paper - it glided like butter.";;
@MacTechG4;"My self-imposed price cap on pens is $200 and under  and in that price range  the Lamy 2000 dominates the list for me  it is the ideal combination of ink capacity  writing feel  durability  and subtle  understated design  I absolutely love the simple form-follows-function Bauhaus design

The pen is an absolute sleeper  amazing writing experience  amazing German precision  from the subtle click of capping the pen  the spring loaded clip  the almost unnoticeable seams between the section and body  and between the body and piston filler cap  the L2K is worth every penny and definitely hits far above it's weight class

I find that the L2K spoils me for any other ""expensive"" ($150-$200) pen  the others are either too gaudy (Montblanc style)  or are lower capacity due to the screw converters (which often need to be purchased separately)  at this price range  the pen should either come *with* the converter  or have some form of integrated ink storage  like a piston fill

I don't want some gaudy eyesore that screams ""look how much money I can waste on frivolous expenditures""  I want something that is designed to *function* first  aesthetics are irrelevant  the subtler the better

Even better  for me  is since I own a L2K  I feel no need for other  ""fancier"" pens  i'd be perfectly content with the L2K as my only gold-nib pen (well  perhaps one more EF L2K as a backup  two is one  one is none  and maybe another in a wider nib width for more expressive writing  but other than that  I'm good with just my L2K  and my Pilot Metro as my ""daily driver"" and loaner  as it also hits above it's weight class  and it's hard to kill a steel nib

that said  I *do* find the Pilot Vanishing Point intriguing  but the converter feed is a minor negative point for me

if you're on the fence at all about the L2K don't be  do yourself a favour and buy yourself one  you won't regret it";;
@lc6705;ptl 5000a is a great gold nib pen for $64;;
@gnomilius;I've just realised  the Platinum Century and the Jinhao x750 have a unusually similar design.;;
@AlexRichter;I own three of these five pens and couldn't more highly recommend the custom 74. Granted  I use it a lot for flex nib calligraphy and it takes some practice to learn to flex it safely. But I love a pen that can go seamlessly between fancy writing and note taking. And... now I'm thinking of getting the falcon to round out my Pilot collection. My wallet curses you all  but I love you guys. Keep up the awesome work and great service.;;

@flabbybum9562;Good call on those pens.  I have two of your top five - the Lamy 2000 and the Platinum 3776  and they both definitely deserve their spots in your top five. I've also got your honorable mention  the Pilot Elite 95S  and it too is a great pen. My personal favorite nib of all time  is actually a discontinued one - the Platinum 3776 medium-fine. Their fine version on the newer 3776  is also very good though. Keep these videos coming!;;
@ComandanteJ;My mom gave me her Lamy 2000 from the 70's  a gift for her first communion  and when I went to fill it up... it disintegrated.

@imresereny2657;"1:58 - Brian  in all respect  just to put it right: the Lamy 200 was in actual fact _not_ ""their founding pen  when they started the company"".

@sebasiouxsierodriguez3638;My first Gold nib Pen was a Parker Sonnet and from this list I own a Lamy 2000  which I love writing with. Very informative video and interesting list. Thx a lot!;;
@citizenz3837;Falcon is my dream right now. I like how the nib looks pointed and how it kind of has a bend on the nib. The pen itself looks very classic the way I like my pens. Unfortunately my parents are avid users of cheap ball pens and they donâ€™t see the worth of spending as much money on fountain pens so I have to literally save up my change and buy them. I currently own a Sheaffer Agio. :(;;
@Sankis;When you do videos like this you should note what color inks you're using during the samples!;;
@NGMonocrom;"Very recently I got back into fountain pens in a very BIG way. Previously I got a beautiful Parker Sonnet for my 40th Birthday three years ago. Before that.... far too many years to count since I enjoyed using a fountain pen. And after my 40th  nothing really took off. But now I went a bit crazy in getting some inexpensive as well as higher priced fountain pens. I'm glad you included the Honorable Mention as I had never even heard of the Pilot E95S before. In fact  I've ended up buying all but two of the six pens on this list. Don't like a nib that is too soft. So the Falcon is out. And I think I might know why Platinum stopped including converters with their 3776. 

I've heard accounts of the stock converters having ink flow and reliability issues. Honestly  it's why I bought the Pilot Custom 74 and a Con-70 converter; instead of the 3776. Couple of weeks back  had ink issues with a medium nib Parker Vector. Happened twice  in a row. I don't mind ink flow issues in a cheap fountain pen  but that just shouldn't happen in one that costs $150+. Just don't want to risk it. Also  having been born into Communist Russia where the quality of domestically produced goods *when they actually were available at all* was very much substandard to the rest of the world. Thus  to me  a fountain pen with feedback or one that is quite ""toothy""; equals cheap junk. Not saying that's what the 3776 is. But hard to get over that experience as a student.";;

@GarrySkipPerkins;I just bought the Platinum 3776  black diamond as my first fountain pen. I also bought the 3776 Briarwood. I bought one fine and one medium. I only bought one converter to test it out before I bought the second converter. I cannot wait to try them out.;;

@jordanw6918;I want either the 3776 or the falcon  and choosing between the two is killing me.;;
@hizokuto;How do these pens rank in bounce? This property is the only reason I'd try my first gold nib. Although I've seen the Ahab's line variation  I've heard that you have to be pretty intentional to get any line variation. I write with a light hand so my concern is not feeling a difference. I'm not into calligraphy so I'm not concerned with achieving the largest line width without springing tines.;;
@carolmelancon;I  for one  am very happy you are Pilot heavy because that's what I chose when getting into fountain pens. I'm so happy to feel I made good decisions when a FP newbie :) I first bought (over a couple of years) 4 Pilot VPs. Coming from a dip pen/calligraphy background  the click function was the deal maker  plus the wonderful nib quality. I bought a couple of custom italic nib units  then learned to grind my own for my needs. The interchangeable nib units are a big plus for me. If it wasn't super-convenient  I'd just use a dip pen. I'd love to see your thoughts on the rotring Art Pen. They are probably more geared to calligraphy  but the nibs write so smoothly  and are so forgiving  it might tempt some of your customers to try a true italic hand.;;
@AndreasJankeEU;I'm just curious: Are Lamy Accent ( http://www.lamy.com/ger/b2c/accent/098_by ) and cp1 ( http://www.lamy.com/ger/b2c/cp_1/053 ) available in the US too? I personally like the Accent more than the 2000 and they are both in the same price range.

@SusanClarkeatenterin;"Because of B.G. and the GPC  I am proud owner of all the pens highlighted here except the E95s.

@jereownby5116;"Hi Brian 
I am a fan. I just watched this video on entry-level gold nabbed pens without looking at the photo first. I was pleasantly surprised to discover I owned every one of these pens. 

So  here's a request for future podcast. You know how you have a podcast about the 2nd level fountain pens? How about a podcast on the 2nd level gold nibbed pens? After you own these top 5 entry-level gold nibbed pens  what would be your suggestion for someone's next step up?

Â Personally  I am only interested in how well the pen writes. I think at some level  you reach a point of diminishing returns and further expenditures of money don't create a better writing experience; they create greater works of art or pieces of jewelry. That's fine for those who want that.

Â For me  it's all about the writing experience. I'd be interested in your thoughts on the 2nd level gold nibbed pens. 

Let's say that you're willing to put in another $50-$100 past these top 5 entry-level gold nibbed pens in this podcast â€” what would be your suggestion for that? 

Do you agree that there is some point at which additional money is not buying an enhanced writing experience but is (justifiably) buying a finer and more beautiful object?

Again  I am a customer and I am a fan. I enjoy your thoughts and appreciate somebody having a passion and a vision and making it come to fruition. Good for you! Keep up the great work.";;
@LapuLapuMagellan;Im about to graduate in law school and I havent used fountain pen with gold nib ever since because they are too expensive.;;

@PositivelyNice;May I know which ink you are using for the Pilot 74 please? I have watched your shading ink video and I wonder whether that ink is one of those shading inks.;;
@Perktube1;Liked them all  esp.  the E95S for style and Lamy 2000 for its capacity. They say the E95S is retro japanese style but since most fountain pen styles don't seem to change much  it comes out looking a bit futuristic  tho not technically so like the Rotring Core.;;
@fabiolean;"I'm so torn between a Custom 74 and an E95-S. The Custom looks more practical  but the E95 is just gorgeous.

@shangakonaporshibergqvist4454;Hi! I have been searching for an exclusive and classic luxury pen for a friend of mine who graduates medical school at the end of this year. I've been watching the videos on this channel  but I have a hard time to decide which one I should go for. I am thinking about something in this range of price (130-200). Is there any you could recommend for a gift? I've heard a lot about Mont Blanc  but I want to engrave the pen  and from what I have heard it's not possible on Mont Blanc pens.

@CSwearingen09;I want the Vanishing Point so bad!

@jpd7;My first gold nib pen was a Platinum #3776 with Music Nib.  I never expected myself to like it so much!;;
@shubhangm.s.4367;what is the best expert level pen ? under 50-100$;;
@ianl464;could you swap the nib on the E95S with the Falcon's  or would the nib being inset prevent that? I want the the body  but not the softness.;;
@bbrachman;Thanks Brian.  I was waiting for this video. I love the idea of a softer  springy nib.  Might I make one suggestion?  Find a left handed person to try the flex and variable line width with all these pens.  Being left handed myself  I wonder if they behave the same as with a right handed person.  I would really be disappointed if I purchased a gold nibbed pen and it will not work for lefties.  Just a suggestion.  (got a lefty in you office someplace?);;
@liuby33;I bought a Sailor Naginata Togi when I was in Japan this summer  and I absolutely loved it. Any chance you will put it on your store? I hope others can get the experience writing with it.;;

@mage7137;do u guys have a video on cleaning and maintainin the twsbi eco? if not  can you make one? thanks;;
@mikefreedom8881;The Custom 74 was also my first gold nib. I love this pen but really disliked the look of demos (aside from a clear demo  the TWSBI 580). If you're like me  here's the solution: those japanese pen also come in solid colors! Order from Japan and you'll get a fabulous classic style pen. Solid colors are not available in the US and that's a shame.;;

@mauliksital9931;@gouletpens .. what about pens from Sailor?;;
@cathymaddox;I was hoping you'd mention the pilot E95S. I love pocket pens and the burgundy E95S is one of the prettiest pens I've ever seen. I'd like to get one for Christmas.;;

@SuperKawaz750;absolutely agree with the pens you have chosen!;;
@Mynimi94;I adore the Pilot E95s. It's my first gold nib and it's THE BEST if you hate posting in general  but are forced to do it when you use the pen on a train for example. This feels just perfect posted. And the vintage look just adds to my love for it.;;

@deadmemesandbrokendreams;thx for the video. It helps narrow down the list.;;
@PresidentFTR;Lamy 2000 was my first ever Gold Nib pen. As someone who started with the Lamy Safari  it's a lot to get used to!;;
@raosprid;The Platinum 3776 Century really is underrated. I have a soft fine in bourgogne and it's one of my absolute favorites. The finish looks great and it writes/draws well. The slip and seal mechanism makes it an ideal partner for pigmented and iron gall inks  too.;;
@lukasmaster1111;Pilot 74 & Platinum 3776 are really great  however I prefer more classic look so my 74 is in all black version. Others pens with gold nibs? Lamy studio with 14k nib I think its bit more cheaper then 2000  or Sailor 1911 Standard. Despite its no longer manufactured I think getting Platinum PTL-5000 is still possible.;;
@ihy8602;I like my 3776 and love my Sailor Pro Gear - just need a Pilot to complete the trio! It's really hard to make a decision with so many different models and nib options.;;
@Drehirth;"I have the Lamy 2000 and the Platinum 3776 Century and one thing that has really stood out is the durability of the former.

 I always disliked how pens made of resin will get scratched sooo easily even from normal use  but the lamy doesn't get those ""micro scratches"" that the resin pens do; if you're bothered by those like I am I extra recommend looking into the Lamy 2000. 

I had mine ground to a custom stub and it's pretty much the only pen I use now because it's also insanely smooth and just ""soft"" enough to sometimes show off the shading of the ink that makes it perfect for me. 

I've also dropped it twice and it STILL looks brand new (I SWEAR i'm not normally that clumsy -.-) so when they mention it's durable in the video I can personally attest to it..";;
@raosprid;"A drawer is where you put your clothes. A person who draws is called a draftsman. ""Artist"" works too  although it's less specific.";;
@Sajen006;Great video  as always! However  I'd like to add something regarding flex videos that use the Pilot Falcon. The nibs used in these videos are often modified for extra flex (from what I've heard at least). If you were to push a stock Falcon nib that far  even with practice  you would spring the nib quite badly!;;
@renumultiplus;Great list! I love the Pilot nibs in that price range.  I purchased a Stargazer (M) from you guys a while ago as a travel/carry pen and am in love with it.;;
@sepioify;YOU THE BEST;;

@squirts1;"holy balls... why is the LS &500???? 
""a bit on the high side""

""completely different pen""
No  sir. It uses the same nib unit. It is in fact just a vanishing point with a different knock mechanism.";;
@iswish_41;I enjoy your content and knowledge. The only thing I dislike is you looking everywhere except the camera. If youâ€™re going to read a script record your videos POV style. I literally never finish your videos because of it. Is too distracting for the audience. Not an attack  just constructive criticism.;;
@mrcat3493;As much as I prefer to support US retailers  the LS is one that I would import. The price in the US is too much.;;
@haomingli6175;"You can get this for half the price in China; but curiously  the standard version is not that much cheaper in China than in the US";;
@fossilimprint2954;Good review  agree this is overpriced for what it is.;;
@Ye110wjacket;I actually prefer the original Vanishing Point/Capless design. This one is a little sleeker but not worth the extra money and it is not totally silent. However  if one can find it for a good price  it would be worth getting.;;
@adurgh;Thank you for the thorough review as always. Getting the regular one. I actually prefer the colicky sound. Definitely not worth it for he LS.;;
@aych131;I absolutely prefer this to the standard VP in everyway. I don't prefer it to $300 more though. Good pen but overpriced for what you're getting;;
@NatiiixLP;As of right now  the Capless LS sits around 400-500 EUR in Europe  and not a whole lot lower on the NA market (350-450 USD)  as far as I can see  but it only costs around 30 000 JPY (200-250 USD) in Japan  if you can find any in stock  so you might want to use a proxy to buy one directly from Japan.;;
@sistergoldenhair0727;Lame!;;
@kdrussaw;Thanks for explaining LS.;;
@georgelim9933;Is the Pilot Fermo still in production? This just feels so overpriced for a twist mechanism if the Fermo still exists. Though the Fermo is only available in 3 finishes..;;
@conceitedperson78;Would have been better to release some updated Fermos  honestly.;;
@vlades5190;heavily overpriced;;
@stimpunk;The twist knob works with ease on my left hand. Had no trouble pushing it with my left thumb to retract the nib. Just want you guys to know that. The LS is really the next-level Capless / Vanishing Point.;;
@kalemarnica32;If you want a silent mechanism  I would go for the Fermo... only marginally more expensive the the regular vanishing point and is completely silent to operate the mechanism. And looks very classy to boot! I will definitely give this model a miss  just too expensive for what it is!;;
@houghwhite411;The price probably tells that it's a proper redesign. They are more expensive to pay for the engineering bills;;
@triciaapplewhite4939;Love the packaging....;;
@MrAndrew1953;I like these pens because of their extra girth but I'm told by my regular dealer that they weren't a success in Australia. They are only available on a special order for over $400 AUD.;;
@Jaibuuuu;This pen is like a Frankenstein between Fermo and Vanishing point.   If you like quietness  the Fermo is better than this  if you like clicking  the Vanishing point is enough. Buying both of them will be cheaper than a single LS as well.;;
@watanabeami378ksubscribers4;Some Japanese retailers on the  internet retails VP ls for about ï¼„245;;
@TTripp1;It seems strange that the nib isn't black. I definitely don't think this pen is worth $440. Maybe $200;;

@GuntherSchmidl;"Got it for a lot less than that from Japan  but it wasn't in that kind of packaging - no ink  sleeve or pouch  but a cartridge  the ""metal thing""  and a converter were included. It's an incredible pen  I love it.";;
@papipupepo0990;I really like this pen but the price scares me a little. What if I can get the pen at 250USD? Would you think it's a better buy than the standard capless at about 140USD?;;
@Jbandes;"I really enjoy your videos and I was hoping you could answer a question. I purchased a pilot custom 823 with a medium nib and the smoothness with which the medium nib writes is amazing. Next I purchased the pelikan m800 with a fine nib and it is scratchy. Do you think my pelican may be defective or just need to be taken someplace and fine-tuned I was expecting the smoothness of the pelican to rival that of the pilot 823.

I noticed that on my pelikan m800 using the loop there was bits of paper in the nib and that the tines were not even so I fixed it and now it is 85% better than it was but still not as smooth as the pilot 823. I also noticed that the pelikan requires almost no pressure to write. 

Is a fine nib pen supposed to have a little bit of scratchiness or can I make it smoother by taking it to a nib master or sanding it. I think because I am new I would prefer to take it to someone to send as I don't want to ruin the nib. Your thoughts will be appreciated thank you.";;
@arirang66;Pilot Capless Fermo - completely clickless!! A better choice!;;

@deanfukawa3260;"Aloha David  good  comprehensive review  as always.  I love the subtle design cues they did with this pen  slimming down the clip profile  adding the waist that hides the joint  scooping out the corners of the closing tab.  Like a lot of Japanese design  it's these subtle things  taken together  bring out the beauty in the design.  As for the price  for some people  there will be value in it.  For others  not so much  and that's OK; to each their own.  Keep up the awesome work and the very best to you and your family this holiday season.";;
@yuklimka7251;In general I love Pilot pens and own a couple. But I don't get the attraction of a fountain pen that looks like a ballpoint. And as a leftie  both the clip and the new knock mechanism don't work for me. It's a hard pass - for both iterations. That being said  thank you for a great comparison video.;;
@sathishrao7926;"I like the standard Vanishing point pen with golden trim.  but at 200 USD ( in India )  it is way too overpriced ! 
Of course I canâ€™t even dream of owning LS variant which may cost 600 USD if and when available in India !";;
@TruthFirst4;"I have one major question.  for one who has approximately 50 pens of variety.  None are gimmicks.  All are standard  a few vintage  some unbranded Chinese  mostly popular quality well tested variety daily writers.  I haven't owned a VP ever. Outside of a capless fountain pen why would one want a vanishing point?  What is it that you gain  need or want when you begin using a vanishing point?  Did I miss that video somewhere in your archives?

I wish the LS was cheaper.  I might own one otherwise. 

Excellent rhythm to your reviews.  If you haven't planned it  you are consistently lucky.  :)   I went back in time yesterday and watch your ND Tyson interview.  That was fun.";;
@adityavikramgupta1715;The LS clip is more like the one that comes in cross pens;;
@solstar4778;Very comprehensive review âœ”ï¸ what nib size are you reviewing? F/M/B â“;;
@Wolverine3660;I have decided to get another one of the older version of the Vanishing Point pen. I think that the new design features are not really all that important for my particular needs.

@colinmartin9797;"Price is an insulting joke just like the 2k bauhaus.

I love pilot but this is just an insulting price. Never going to buy it  though if it was a $250 version  came in a decimo size  and had the full damn nib option range (seriously  you make EF and stubs but won't offer them?) I would jump on it.";;

@allanknight843;Have you saw the new Scotty Cameron pen?;;
@bikkies;"I don't feel myself drawn to this and  so far  I've steered clear of the VP altogether  due to the clip placement. That flick mechanism to retract the nib on this model also looks like it could rattle around a bit in use  but no doubt it wouldn't. In any event  in today's episode of ""things I didn't know that I didn't know""  I learned the mechanism is called a knock. After 50 years of ballpoint use (only seeing the FP light within about the last year) I've never wondered what it's called  and now that really surprises me. Maybe I'd have gone with clicker  button or just thingy. Now I know to call it a knock  so thanks for that :)";;
@gordonmattingly2689;I have owned three of the standard vanishing points. I love just about aspect of them but have had problems I the deployment mechanism. I donâ€™t consider them durable against price. Pilot failed in that respect.;;
@theredbar-cross8515;FYI: There are very  very few left handed people in East Asia. This is why you rarely see lefty friendly features.;;
@rztour;Nothing more comforting than the close of a cap  knowing my nib wonâ€™t soon be drying up. Trap door aside and whatever that means in keeping the nib from drying out  a nib itself is a thing of beauty. The end of it poking out doesnâ€™t do it for me in these VPâ€™s.;;
@wittwittwer1043;"I have two original style ""fat"" VPs and a Decimo VP. I like the Decimo the best because it is thinner and has a narrower clip. It also has narrower center bands  unlike the ""Michelin-tire"" center bands on the ""fat"" Pilots. The LS is overpriced  and I don't think the nib retraction mechanism is necessary. As far as noise  I have a Parker T-ball Jotter and plastic Pilot G-2 gel pen  both of which are as noisy (or noisier) as the VPs. I'm not sure how ""nock/knock"" should be spelled  but in any case it is a new term to me. I call it a plunger or an actuator.";;
@WritingDelight;"I have to say I like the mechanism of the LS. It is again a unique feature. And I think the Capless / Vanishing Point is a good seller for Pilot. Otherwise they wouldn't make so many variants. 
And Platinum brought the Curidas out at beginning of the year  which is  lets be honest  rather similar.  :)

But price... well  that is always a talking point. One that doesn't vanish. ;)";;
@meh8982;The Fermo was completely silent and simple to operate  and has a more attractive style in my opinion.  Also less expensive than this LS.  Not sure how this is an improvement.;;

@markcollins2876;I have never seen a vanishing point in person  but I really donâ€™t like the look.;;
@mtbrdude;Whoa! I was on board until you said the price. I may as well order another custom Edison or something.;;
@alanpareis734;Great detailed review thank you. It would look cool with the red ring. I will be interested to see what it looks like in the other colors.  Never-the-less  at that price not for me.;;
@claytonsanders508;Pilot CON-40 is definitely a top contender for worst converter in the world.;;
@ghjbnbvnnbv9169;Thank you very much for this review. As a lefty this is sadly a no-go :(;;
@MrJAM-np7go;I had some vintage VPs(cs-100  300  from 60s) and modern ones  but I found the wooden version of modern VP has the best balance for me. It is a tad lighter than normal lacquered brass ones  and thicker than the aluminium decimo models.;;
@curtism5333;"When I saw the huge box that it came in with the branded little leather pouch etc.  I knew that the price would be eye-watering.  Although the redesign of the nib 'pro/retraction' mechanism is interesting  I personally dislike the thinner knock on the LS.  OTOH  I think I would prefer the thinner clip. The price is a resounding no for me. 

Thanks again for this review.";;
@Matt-wg9or;Lovely pen  but the price is just prohibitive. If you want an luxurious retractable nib the Lamy Dialog is a less expensive (and itâ€™s more beautiful  in my opinion). Otherwise the original VP is simply too good a deal to pass over.;;
@rob_ward;Thank you Pilot for ignoring us lefties. ?Ÿ˜  A genuine thank you to David for mentioning the oversight though. ?Ÿ‘ Iâ€™ll wait and see if they address the problem in the future  and maybe realise that the price point is disproportionate.;;
@ShahriarFarkhan;Thank you for doing a review on this. I have wondered why Pilot chose to make a version of the VP that costs so much more but I haven't seen a review on it. I love mine but I'd rather buy two than one of these.;;
@robertalvarez8689;I can put up with the slightly louder click to save the money. I would rather spend $800 for that raden one you've got.;;
@edreilly6674;It's different and nice but not a whole new pen and clearly too expensive once you own that.;;
@13noman1;"Thanks for this review.  I've liked VPs and have several -- the ""original"" (plastic)  the ""modern"" (metal body) and was a bit tempted at first by this -- but not for that price and honestly  probably not at all.  My VPs are currently all in storage for two main reasons:  one  they're small for my hand and two  the ink capacity is rather paltry.  I really liked the convenience of the ""click"" and found them all to have wonderful nibs but I don't need to add another take on the VP for $400 to sit in storage.";;
@archivist17;"A beautifully elegant pen  and from one of my favourite pen makers  too!  Nice mechanism  but...*crashing sound*..I'm left handed.  It's pretty inconsiderate as a design  so thanks for pointing that out.

Also...$$$$$$$!!!!!!! :o";;
@johnathanrhoades7751;Just got a 90 dollar steel nib Capless. I'm good ?Ÿ˜„;;
@DrRWH;David  I think you are spot on. I am sure they put a lot of R & D into this and some effort on the production line. And maybe their price is fair. But I am left handed and would like the ability to switch the mechanism. It feels a bit thoughtless. And I would rather pay more for a swisher barrel or less as it stands. And I agree $100-$150 bucks less seems about right. Shame. A bit like the Curidas  nearly a good pen but it just misses.;;
@mrcharon6197;Great review as always David. I was intrigued by this pen and it's redesign elements  but the pen feels over priced for what it is. Too many other options at that price point. You can get the same nib in the original chassis and still have the same poor ink capacity for a lot less...unless you want the pen to be near silent. Where's the fun in that. Besides it's a ZOOM meeting world right now.;;
@davidmcguigan5497;Lefties lose again  just not right! Neither is the price for a variation on a familiar theme. Nice review  thanks! Enjoy the close-ups you're able to get. Good health to you!;;
@Hexsyn;It is interesting to me that there are so many differences in general dimensions.  I expected it to be pretty much the same on the outside with just the internals changed.;;
@Hawker900XP;Con-40 yikes.;;
@roderickfemm8799;The process or noise of clicking my VP (or my Decimo) never bothered me. The problem I had was that the mechanism of closing off the nib didn't seem to keep the nib from drying out for more than a couple of days. Is there any improvement in that mechanism (i.e. the trap door thing that closes off the nib) from the standard VP? I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who has tried it.;;
@Alvenrik1;Uh  another fidget toy equiped with a fountain pen from pilot.;;
@welcometotheworldwithsean;"I keep thinking about getting a VP specifically because it's an affordable gold nib. I'm just not a fan of hooded nibs. While the mechanism is cool  I feel it loses its value once it surpasses 200 USD. 

Thanks for another great review! The comparisons were helpful!";;
@MyNameIsPetch;$300 if you order from japan;;
@pensplanners6460;"I appreciate the redisign and new mechanism  but as a user  to me it's the same pen and same nib minus the ""click sound"". That absolutely doesn't justify the price being multiplied by 2.5 .";;
@KB-cx2dr;What about the nib  doesn't it dry out  sooner than other nibs?;;
@Kurazaybo;Another comment about price: I just can't believe it.;;
@luccasnovaes5691;"Im pretty sure that adding silicone ou other types of â€œrubber likeâ€ materials  or making a spring of a different material would reduce the clicking noise  and cost... 5?10? Dolars more.
What i really appreciated was the new slimmer clip design. 
The price? Falls into â€œtrendy/limited edition way of stealing money that has become a way in industryâ€";;
@EmilehUnk;Want a silent capless fountain pen  use a Lamy Dialog3. ?Ÿ¤ª;;
@Winston_Smith_84;Thatâ€™s a cool pen but think about how many Twinkies you could get for the same money! ?Ÿ¤” AND they have shelf life thatâ€™s so long you could eat em all before they spoil! ?Ÿ˜‹;;
@chrislj2890;I believe that Yama budo is considered to be magenta. As for the pen  unlike the Raden Vanishing Point  the price just isn't justifiable in my mind. But I would expect that a company as big and successful as Pilot has a solid business strategy concerning this product.;;
@lukaszpokoju;When I compare the 2  it seems to me that the Pilot Vanishing Point LS is as expensive for what it is  as the Standard Vanishing Point is cheap for what it is.;;
@doyourealiseiamaghost5862;I wonder if the higher price of Japanese pens in the western countries has something to do with antitrust legislation ?Ÿ§;;
@lp343;Nothing to see keep scroling;;
@Danny.._;"i'm a huge fan of the vanishing point line. my first real fountain pen was a matte black vanishing point. i bought a vanishing point ""raden stripe"" for $614 because the craftsmanship  design  etc. were worth it  but I can't bring myself to pay as much as they're asking for this LS model. it just isn't worth it.";;
@defenestrationwindow7827;While not obviously a direct feature  for me a small positive about the vp is the click. I personally like a good pen click. Although I can see the appeal of a silent mechanism;;
@kwhui737;Agree  the price is higher than expected.;;
@garethwilliams3919;"The ""knock"" - and there was me thinking it was a button...";;
@m.w.7919;I fear I might play the mechanism to death  it looks very fun to fiddle with^^;;
@ForTheLoveOfPens;I mentioned a few times in this video that the Vanishing Point has a 14K nib  it is actually 18K.;;
@kurtsell8376;I might agree  but yesterday I got a pilot cap-less Decimo and  though itâ€™s totally subjective  think itâ€™s totally superior in feel and weight.;;
@richardsimms251;Nice video.  Thank you;;
@vex123;Hi   I just purchased the Vanishing Point from Japan.  Unfortunately I'm pretty noob  but with the stock ink cartridge (black)  I'm getting A LOT of skipping with barely any ink coming out on any upward strokes.  Do you have any tips or know what might be wrong?;;
@AndrewWertheimer;Good review. I also bought the mate black  which I love for note taking. I used to think it was so ugly in the bright colors and chrome colors  but have a few now. I agree with you about the strengths and weaknesses  esp the COn-40.;;
@TheCuttingEdge-LCK;I just ordered two of these pens. A fiine and a stub for different uses. Right now my main pocket pen is a TWSBI Mimi AL Fine or a Travelers Company Brass in fine. I am looking forward to the VP's. They are the pens I have always wanted! Thanks for the review!;;
@MichaelDelugg;Nice demo -- really good work.;;
@doejohn6197;Update? Has the matte colored one faded away??;;
@anchitchakrabarti2179;"I have a question though
Does the matt black paint start to peel off as it ages?
Otherwise i was thinking of the stripes version which a bit more expensive
Could you please ans this question";;
@chrisgraham5036;I just bought my first VP! I'm interested in switching to cartridges as demonstrated  but I can't find the empty ones online for the life of me. Any tips on where to find them?;;
@JuanRodriguez-qb8qm;Fenomenal;;
@JuanRodriguez-qb8qm;fenomenal.;;
@JuanRodriguez-qb8qm;;;
@JustDianeLynn;I'm new to fountain pens so excuse my ignorance but did this pen come with an empty cartridge or is that something you had? Thank you.;;
@ellieisbusy;My Capless (thatâ€™s also its name in Europe) is my current favourite pen. I can write with it for 30 minutes straight without an issue. The M nib is so smooth.;;
@anrun;Don't forget to use the cartridge cover when you use carts in this pen.  The VP isn't my first choice for lengthy writing session  but I still find it suitable for them.;;
@asfasfd7772;Fine for quick notes  terrible for long writing sessions.  Too heavy.;;
@videogamesare1;Super useful video  thank you;;
@lord_haven1114;It isnâ€™t my cup of tea. I want to be able to see the nib in all its gorgeous glory. If I wanted a click pen where I canâ€™t really see or enjoy the look of the nib I can just get a 20 dollar ball point clicker. Thereâ€™s some pretty nice ones for around that price ?Ÿ¤£;;
@thedirtygot9570;Love my black and gold vanishing point! Very handy! I just use a syringe to fill the converter!;;
@animula6908;I saw a guy on YouTube talking about using the majohn a1 converters because they outdid pilot on them. I havenâ€™t tried it  but if so I will buy Moonman knockoffs just to get the converters for my other pilot pens. I use their cartridges just because those converters suck.;;
@bfs5113;"I went for the slimmer version Decimo and cut a 1/2"" piece of the rubber from the 207 to fit around the clip area for a more comfortable grip.";;
@Schein1307;Would a Con70 work? I doubt because it is also a push mechanism like the VP  unless it incuded a bulkier sleeve;;
@sathishrao7926;"When I was just about to comment on 18K Vs 14K  I saw your Video description !
Iâ€™ll use it as a â€˜Notes takerâ€™ when Iâ€™m at home.. But my Notes taker outside is Majohn A1 or A2 or Platinum Curidas..
At $200  VP has been my most expensive pen and I donâ€™t like to drop it/lose it while using it in the â€˜fieldâ€™ !";;
@philnaunton7181;"I have several of these pens and a couple of knock-offs. A well done  thorough review. Surprisingly I learned a few new things about this pen  which I have had for years.
Someone mentioned an Old Dog and New Tricks. Thanks.";;
@sebenzalover;This is a new channel but what a gem. I enjoy your insight and thoughts. Looking forward for more from this channel.;;
@user-gl5ld9vm7i;My Pilot Vanishing Point is my favorite fountain pen. I quite like the mechanical design of it  and I appreciate not having to unscrew a cap. Plus my broad 18K gold nib ALWAYS writes  and sings!;;
