1749059567-1;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;The pen is a bit weighty, but it writes very smoothly. It looks very sleek. I use it every day. A great addition to any fountain pen collection.;;
1749059567-2;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;Mothers Day gift, This pilot retractable is incredible! I popped in the cartridge, waited 5 minutes and started writing. It’s gorgeous, the weight is perfectly proportional with the clip adding to the overall comfort. I LOVE IT!;;
1749059567-3;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I have taken a liking to retractable fountain pens. I purchased the Majohn A1 Press Fountain Pen (no clip). It was good enough to get me started, but I finally purchase the Pilot Vanishing Point. The Pilot is hands down the best even with the serious upcharge. The mechanism and ink flow is better, the nib is just smoother, and the fact that the Majohn has not clip, and the Pilot does, actually is a detriment for Majohn and a great feature for Pilot and it has nothing to do with clipping in your pocket. Putting the Pilot in your hand aligned with the clip automatically sets the nib in the proper angle and flow—with the Majohn I find myself looking and feeling my way towards that even flow. Both have nice heft, and both fill easily. Pilot for me.;;
1749059567-4;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;Honestly what can I say. This is one of, if not the best everyday carry fountain pens on the market. This pen paired with a nice ink that doesn't feather or bleed on cheap paper(like Noodlers Black or Diamine Registrars) is perfect for daily use on any type of paper. No cap to loose track of, nib doesn't dry out, if you do drop it nothing gets damaged(as long as the nib is retracted). Perfect. The only real downside is that, as you have probably heard, the CON-40 is pretty much worthless. Not only does it have a very low capacity but you cant even get it to fill all the way up most the time. SO if you are going to use bottled ink, I would HIGHLY recommend just scooping up some blunt tip syringes for a couple bucks here on amazon and refilling the cartridges. One cartridge can be refilled MANY times, and then you get good ink capacity again(about 0.9ml). Which lasts a LONG time with a fine or extra fine nib.;;
1749059567-5;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I love how practical this fountain pen is and enjoy taking it with me when I'm out and about.  Especially to work and church.  So quick and easy to activate and put away when not using so the nib doesn't dry out!  Writes wonderful.  I ordered some blue/black ink because the color that came with it is a bit lighter than I prefer.

So glad I took a chance and ordered this pen.  I believe I will end up using it a lot; it is so practical and convenient compared to messing with a cap.";;
1749059567-6;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;Wow, writes so smooth. It writes like butter in a Hobonichi. What a wonderful product, I'm so excited I found it! Trying to drum up things I need to write about! The writing experience and balance of this pen are worth the price.;;
1749059567-7;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"The Pilot Vanishing Point is a classic, a mostly amazing pen that certainly deserves a high level of distinction. Unfortunately, it also has some problems that you should be aware of before you decide to buy one.

Packaging is very decent, not quite as nice as it used to be, but you get a sort of cheap-feeling hinged display box.

The pen itself is of course beautiful, with truly excellent build quality and weight. It feels great in the hand, although it does take some getting used to holding it at the clip for writing. The retractable nib mechanism for which the pen is named is impressively well engineered and works flawlessly. Of course that's the whole point.

The nib itself -- I opted for fine point here -- is truly quite fine. And it is a joy to write with. It has a certain springiness or I might even say bounciness, that's absent in any other fountain pen I own, that makes it particularly fun to write with. The writing experience is not what I would call perfectly smooth, but it's also not scratchy per se. It's hard to explain, but the pen delivers a lot of what some people refer to as ""feedback"" and it's basically the feeling of the pen interacting with the paper. Usually I find it to be objectionable in any form, but with this pen I actually quite enjoy it. It's a unique writing experience to be sure.

Now the bad parts...

First and foremost, the pen's converter is, quite bluntly, an overengineered piece of crap. Its piston mechanism is huge, its fill capacity is tiny, and if you fill it via the pen's exceedingly long nib your capacity will be even lower. Furthermore, it is impossible to see the level of the remaining ink without removing the converter and risking a mess. And the converter is extremely tight fitting, but not in a good way if that makes sense. It needs to be forced in and out and you're never quite sure it's been properly seated, until you don't get a leak.

The solution to the majority of the converter problems? Re-use a spent cartridge, and fill it from a syringe. You'll get a much better fill, a much nicer seal, and altogether a better experience. However, syringe filling such an otherwise advanced seeming pen is annoying and feels like it should be unnecessary. I consider this to be a major, major flaw. And since the cartridge needs to be sheathed in a metal sleeve in order to fit into this pen, you still can't see the ink level. Pilot really needs to take another look here.

The second flaw is quite minor, but sort of annoying and something to keep in mind. This issue is a minor leak that can occur inside of the barrel of the pen, due to the quick action of the retraction mechanism. Basically, if you treat this pen like a ballpoint and retract by clicking and then letting go, the nib flies back into the barrel and is then abruptly stopped. A drop of ink that's sitting in the feed can fly back at this point, creating a little pool that you'll have to clean up next time you fill the pen. The good news is, this usually doesn't happen to the point where the pen leaks. The other good news is that you can avoid this issue, by simply being a bit more gentle on the release when you retract the nib. Again, though, I feel that this could have been engineered away, e.g. by slightly softening the retraction mechanism.

All in all, I do recommend this pen. It's pricey, it's a bit flawed, but it's a one-of-a-kind experience that you'll certainly enjoy. Buy yourself some syringes, find some cool ink, and get writing.";;
1749059567-8;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"The thought of having a clip in the way of my fingers made me discount this pen completely.

A friend continually sales pitched me on a vanishing point and since he unfortunately lives in another state, I couldn't actually try his.

After about a month of his pestering, I decided to go ahead and order one.

As soon as I removed it from the box and picked it up, I was very impressed with the weight, balance, and overall feel.  The color and pattern with the rhodium trim match really well.

Not really having an ink that matches the pen, I decided to order some, but it wouldn't arrive until the following day so in the meantime I went ahead and inked it up with Pilot iroshizuku kon-peki since I have all the patience of a child on Christmas morning and wasn't going to wait until the following day.

I ordered the medium since Japanese nibs tend to be a bit finer than western nibs and the line width I'd say is somewhere between a western fine and medium, perhaps even fine in some examples of western nibs.

My biggest concern was whether or not the nib would have a ton of feedback, similar to a Sailor nib.  I have a Sailor 1911L and while I do enjoy writing with it, I've learned that my preference is minimal feedback.  This nib definitely has some feedback, but is basically exactly what I like.

To a lesser extent my other concern is the nib drying out, but as I look down the end of the barrel of the pen and watch how the trap door works, I'm not as concerned.

One of the other reasons I wanted this pen was for a small field notes notebook I carry around.  I have a Galen Leather cover for it, and most of my fountain pens are much too large to carry around, and typically if I'm jotting a note down, unscrewing a cap would take too long whereas this pen is quickly deployed to jot some fast notes down.

If this pen starts giving me issues, I'll make sure to come back to update this review, but I don't see that happening as this pen is well crafted.";;
1749059567-9;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I love this pen! Before this I had a decimo so I had gotten used to the retractable pen and the clip position but the vanishing point is much better, I like the weight and the size. This type of pen took a while to get used to because of the clip position and I’m left handed but once I got used to it, it was all i wanted to use. I love that the nib is 18k gold and on the matte black it’s a gunmetal color which is just lovely. The extra fine nib is so smooth and has some bounce to it. I inked it and it worked straight away. It came with a blue cartridge which I didn’t use, and a con40 which I did use.;;
1749059567-10;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I was expecting to take at least a week to receive my order.  However, it only took three days.  I placed an order on the 17th, then it was shipped on the 18th, and I finally received it on the 20th.  Cool!

The product includes a conversion cartridge.  So, if you already have a bottle of ink, then just fill it up and it is good to go.  If not, it also includes a disposable cartridge.  A sheet of user's manual accompanies this product.

Pro:  No cap to worry about.  Click -- the nib comes out.  Click again -- the nib retracts.  Its built-in pocket clip makes it very easy to carry around.

Con:  Because of the way the pocket clip is located, it can become a source of discomfort since your index finger will be pressing against it.

I have been using two other fountain pen:  Waterman Phileas medium nib and Waterman Moonlight Hemisphere fine nib.  It took me a while before these two became responsive to my touches.  Pilot Vanishing Point, by contrast, did not need to be broken in at all.  I was able to write smoothly right after I filled up the conversion cartridge for the very first time.  Therefore, insofar as getting started:  Pilot Vanishing Point fine nib > Waterman Moonlight Hemisphere fine nib.  While Pilot Vanishing Point costs more than Waterman Phileas and Moonlight Hemisphere, I would recommend the former over the latter two.

Update:  04/24/2012

The twist converter cartridge included with the package can become a source of irritation:  It does not hold that much ink.  An additional source of irritation is that the transparent portion of the converter cartridge is obscured by the metal cylincer surrounding it.  I have noticed that some fountain pen merchants do carry squeeze cartridges for Namiki/Pilot brand fountain pens.  Based on user reviews, squeeze cartridge is superior to screw converter cap.  Unfortunately, Amazon.com is not one of them.

Update:  05/02/2012

5 stars minus 1:  The twist converter seems to be more than a minor nuisance.  Not only its capacity is rather limited (Waterman twist converter capacity is better, but cannot be adopted to Pilot), it does not seem to fit securely.  I have noticed that my pen has been leaking (although not severe enough to stain objects outside the outer casing).  I plan on purchasing a squeeze converter (Con-20) and see if this would solve two problems -- capacity and leaking -- in one go.  I will update this entry as soon as I start using it.

Update:  05/11/2012

Installed Con-20 squeeze converter.  No more leakage.  Better reservoir capacity.  Pilot should include Con-20 squeeze converter instead of Con-50 twist converter as part of its Vanishing Point package.  Why include a substandard converter while there is already a superior counterpart to otherwise a fine writing instrument?

As for the difference in the reservoir capacity between Con-50 and Con-20.  This has to do with the fact that it is next to impossible to completely remove the pocket of air lingering in Con-50 twist converter even after several consecutive draw/purge actions.  In short, its ink reservoir stays underutilized.

Update:  07/26/2012

Upon closer inspection, there are some leakage from the nib groove.  Although, I think this has little to do with mechanical problems.  I have been using Noodler's Black Eel ink and I remember reading something about other Noodler ink users having similar issues.  This leakage is nothing to worry about; it merely coats a part of the nib and does not lead to staining papers.  I wonder if other ink brands have this issue as well, although I will not be shopping for new ink any time soon.

Update:  12/11/2014

1749059567-26;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I'm relatively new to fountain pens, but I've been using a pair of medium priced Parker fountain pens daily at work and home for almost a year now, and they are great.  Work well, write smoothly, travel well, and none of the mess that I used to encounter as a child with my first fountain pens.  For Christmas though, I decided I was going to invest in a better quality pen to use daily.  I wasn't looking for a piece of art necessarily, but I wanted a professional looking pen that delivered a truly superior writing experience.  I write a lot in my work and I am in front of executives regularly.  I researched for some time the various manufacturers in the US, Europe  and Japan and read user reviews both pro and con. In the end I kept coming back to the Pilot Vanishing Point.  My other fountain pens are medium nib.  They write smoothly with good ink delivery, but I wanted a fine point.  I read several user references that said the Japanese make finer nibs, so that a Japanese medium is more like a European fine point.  I really wanted a fine point, but I decided to stick with a medium nib for the Pilot.  That turned out to be the right decision.  The nib on the Vanishing Point delivers ink with the smoothness of a medium but produces a fine line that dries quickly.  Absolutely no skipping or blotching. This pen frankly makes my not-so-neat handwriting look much more legible and professional even when writing quickly.
Mechanically, the Vanishing Point is amazing.  The engineering is flawless and works with a solid feel that inspires confidence that this pen will serve me well for a lifetime.  And as it turns out, it also looks like a work of modern art as an added bonus.  The rhodium accents are beautiful and the Carbonesque pattern on the barrel is striking, lending a subtle feel of texture to the grip.
My only complaint is with the delivery. The ink cartridge included with the pen exploded in transit and sent ink all over the inside of the case.  Fortunately, the pen was not affected and the Vanishing Point comes with a converter so I am able to use bottled ink.
The twist converter draws ink into the pen easily and with no inky fingers afterward.  A quick wipe of the nib and I was back in business.
I would recommend this pen to anyone who is looking to ""kick it up a notch"", especially if you're got a little bit of fountain pen experience and are hesitating to invest in a more expensive pen.  This one is well worth the price!";;

The reason I haven't used fountain pens prolifically has been two-fold: system portability and usage.  Addressing the later first, I love the feel of this pen!!  Very easy to write with mis-use, which makes this a phenomenal teaching tool; I consider it ""self-correcting"" when I place the nib incorrectly on the paper.  I have been trying to teach myself better penmanship; yet for work, I often need to note acronyms, sketch quick diagrams, etc.  This pen handles everything with ease.  Addressing system portability: I fill, on average, four to eight full page notes in my Moleskine notebook per day.  Some days zero.  I fly frequently, several times per month.  I was hyper-concerned about using this pen for work: potential leakage, ability to take notes quickly, ink reservoir in relationship to refill length, etc.  I clip the pen to Moleskine, and toss in my bag.  I half-heartedly try to ensure the pen is vertical, but the bag not so.  I have had zero issues.  I was concerned what pressure changes would do at altitude; no issues.  I was concerned about being to rapidly take a flurry of notes with no notice; zero issues.  I love this pen!!  It is my everyday always pen.  I currently try to fill it about every two weeks or so.  I've noticed about a 10-12 day refill cycle would be better, although it is based on a limited sample size.

I have had two issues:  I didn't care for the stock ink so I tossed the stock cartridge out of the box as I use Noodler's ink, the refill cartridge twist/plunger process took a bit to get used to. I spent the best part of a weekend practicing and writing and refilling and learning about it.  By Monday, I felt very comfortable with using the pen in all of the above scenarios.

The second issue I've had is minor: I bent the clip.  I was able to return to its original position; however, its not ""tight"" on the body.  Oh well.  It's minor to me.

I absolutely love this pen and has allowed me to get back to script writing on my pace, when I'm able to.  It always strikes up a conversation with observant customers.";;
1749059567-28;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This was my very first experience with a fountain pen. I read a review and having always been a pen and pencil geek since I was a kid in 4th grade and got my first Cross pen & pencil set, I've always been looking for that Holy Grail of a writing instrument. I was always interested in fountain pens but I had two misconceptions, when I thought of fountain pens I thought, ""Oh, you have to dip them in ink or something? Sounds like a pain."" - and two...intimidation factor. Thinking about having to get inks, and thinking mess to clean up, no thanks. Anyway...

So I read about the VP. I thought, Wait a minute, it looks just like a regular pen, that's odd. And its a click fountain pen, like a regular pen. So I watched  a video or two, and I knew I had to have it. I got the fountain pen, it came with a cartridge converter (with which I had no idea of how to use it straight out of the box - obviously first fountain pen) and then two ink cartridges - which immediately was a relief  - I popped in the ink cartridge, bam! was immediately writing like a pro. I fell instantly in love with this fountain pen. I've had it a few months now. I've written hundreds of pages with it. I wouldn't trade it for any other fountain pen I have (or pen or pencil for that matter). Of course now I only use the cartridge converter and I have way too many bottles of ink that I love switching out all the time. Then there is the fact I now have 13 other fountain pens to vie for my attention - but if I know I'm going to be writing all day this is the pen I know that is going to be in my hand.

Warning: once you get hooked on fountain pens, its a long way down the rabbit hole chasing Alice and that crazy bunny rabbit

The Pilot Vanishing Point is definitely worth the money. Love it. Oh and the Matte Black...definitely the way to go. [I bought the medium nib, but you can buy separate nib units specifically for the Vanishing Point - so you can have a broad, a fine, medium, etc - so you don't have to buy multiple fountain pens - so it really makes the utility of this pen even more utility-ish]";;
1749059567-29;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;so I am absolutely obsessed with this pen, the last three days were heaven. Satisfying click, amazing writing and truly enjoyable. Unfortunately, the pen stopped clicking within 3 days when I tried refilling the ink. I watched all “how to” videos and did everything I possible can. I am returning it and recording in hopes that I got a faulty pen and a piece fell out to make the contraption work! I cried trying to figure it out for three ours then gave up;;
1749059567-30;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"The convenience of this pen is nothing I'd have ever imagined from a fountain pen. As an owner of several high-end fountain pens that cost hundreds of dollars more than this pen, I'd have to say this pen is approaching the status of ""favorite"" among my collection. As a writer, I often jot down personal notes even as I'm at my computer. This pen eliminates the steps that I've been taking in the past to unscrew the cap, place the cap,  position the pen, etc. The clip, though right in the middle of the tripod of fingers for writing, acts as a guide for finger placement as to where the point of the nib will be. There's no more need to rotate the pen in your hand to get the correct writing angle as the clip helps to remind and position your hand for you. I'd actually say that this would be a great starter pen for anyone interested in the art of writing with a fountain pen.

Typically when using a fountain pen, I grip the pen closer to the nib than maybe I'd ought to leaving the tell-tale signs of writing stained on my fingers. With this pen, there's no chance of ink stain because the nib is shielded from any grip mishaps. Though the ink sac is small, I find that it is enough to take several pages of notes over the course of about two-three days. Part of owning a fountain pen is the small joy of refilling it. I haven't tried using the cartridge that came with it as I prefer to draw my ink from a bottle.

The quality of the pen seems to be pretty nice. Though the barrel doesn't exactly feel high-end, it is definitely sturdy and well made. The nib is firm but with enough flex. Some reviews that I've read about this pen made it seem that if you've got a firm hand when writing this pen might not be for you. I don't think that I accurate. Granted I don't try to poke holes in the pages when I write, I do find that this pen is firm enough for just about any type of handwriting style. I have not had any slips or dry spots on the page either even when writing softer or more firmly than I normally would.

I would buy this pen again.";;
1749059567-31;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"The original ""vanishing point"" in my small collection of fountain pens carries the Namiki brand name, though the parent is Pilot which is now the primary name for the new ""vanishing point.""

Although I had looked at catalog descriptions & pictures of the new model, it's taken a long time & a great deal to decide on trying this newer model.

If you are new to the vanishing point fountain pen, the name is really a clever way to describe the mechanism that extends & retracts the point with a push button just like a ballpoint pen. It's certainly ingenious. If you think that the point is exposed to the air when not in use, it's not--it's concealed by a clever internal flap. That means the ink doesn't dry out easily & stays fluid for a long period.

Now my personal feelings about the pen. As noted I have the previous model and the reader may benefit from a comparison. The original pen has beveled fluting which makes the grip comfortable and reduced slippage. The new pen is smooth. The older pen has a narrow barrel with a slimmer taper at the end where the shirt clip ends. The new pen is wider and heavier than the previous model.

This is not to say that I dislike the new model. If I was new to the vanishing point, I'd be perfectly happy. Since I can compare, I do prefer the feel of the older model as well as the design aesthetic, except for the color choices. The new model has nice colors & more variety. The color I chose is the  Blue Carbonesque with Rhodium and it is handsome though my expectation was for a darker hue. Nevertheless I am satisfied.  I had wanted to try a wide nib (which uses more ink) but it wasn't available at the time and so have the medium. It is fine and most of my fountain pens are medium nibs. The Pilot nib is smooth as silk.

The entire package is nice. Large heavy-duty case...one blue ink cartridge...a converter is included if you'd like to use bottle ink...instruction booklet. All in all, still a great product. Just think, you can write with a fountain pen without the bother of dealing with a cap. Fabulous.";;
1749059567-32;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This is my second of the same model.  The first is just fine.  I just wanted to have another to travel with.

I really don't know what I can say as it is exactly as advertised.  It is a retractable fountain pen that can use bottled ink or prepackaged ink cartridges.  I've got a couple bottled inks, and the amount of money I've saved on ""disposable"" pens over the decade since I bought my first one of these probably has added up to the cost of it or surpassed it.

It writes great, and there isn't much maintenance that it needs to keep doing so.";;
1749059567-33;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I just received this pen, but I can already tell it’s going to be one of my favorites.

It writes so nicely, looks and feels luxurious in my hand, and is exceptionally portable considering it’s a fountain pen.

The only thing I don’t like is how hard it is to fill the pen with ink using the converter that comes with it. I’d suggest just getting an ink cartridge instead if you write a lot and it bothers you.";;
1749059567-34;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Overall, I really like this pen and after committing to using quality paper, it is my every day writer.  I've had mine for almost three years and am looking to purchase another one.  Wear issues/scratches with the matte black barrel is the only con.

Pros:
-The stock nibs are excellent (I've used the extra fine and medium and have settled on the medium).
-The balance and size (for my hand) is great.
-The convenience of no cap makes this versatile for intermittent use (taking notes for example).
-Griping around the clip does not bother me and actually serves as a tactile indication of orientation.  (I'm often annoyed by the lack of this indication in most capped fountain pens as there typically is axial symmetry in the grip area, though the nib requires a particular orientation.)  I concede that this is a matter of how you grip your pen and address a writing surface, so if you're unsure you should really try one.
-I have not had issues with the pen drying out, nor have I had any issues with filling/cleaning.
-I have not had leak nor ink on the hands issues.  (I should note that the ""trap door"" does rub on the nib and this seems to smear some ink around the nib itself and the ""door"".  These parts are recessed within end of the pen so any ""mess"" is contained and not touched with normal handling (excluding of course the nib, but you'd expect that to have ink on it right?).  If you're bothered just knowing there's a ""mess"" in there, then you might not want this pen; but then again there's a little vile of ink sloshing around in all fountains so fountain pens might just not be your thing.)

Con:
-I suggest avoiding the matte black barrel option.  Though I really like the low key look of the matte black, I've had wear issues.  The finish appears to be very ""soft"" and scratches easily.  (See photo.)  Admittedly, the photo shows wear after three years of regular carry and use, but it is not as though I leave the pen in my pocket with my keys.  Thus the -1 star and my perusing for the next most subtle color option that has a gloss finish.  (I'm guessing that the gloss finish will wear better.)";;
1749059567-35;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This pen fits comfortably in my hand, though some people are apparently bothered by the placement of the clip - try before you buy or make sure you can return it.

The pen is heavier than some FPs, which I like - if you prefer feather-light pens, it may not be for you.

Bear in mind that this pen is ideally intended for jotting quick notes, as it allows easy one-handed operation; for this type of use, the clip and weight may not be much of an issue. They may not bother you much for a few minutes here and there. If you really need to write many pages, you will probably use a different pen anyway.

The nib is smooth and has good ink flow - among the nicest I have used. It feels a bit bouncy on the page (though it is not a flex nib) due to it's thin size and use of relatively soft 18k gold. Replacement nibs are cheap, so you can have different sizes; people like Richard Binder and John Mottishaw sell custom-ground nibs so that you can play with stubs, italics, and etc if desired. Very handy.

The only other caveat is that the ink capacity is relatively small, since much of the pen's internal space is taken up with the mechanism that allows the nib to be retracted. Once again, this should not be an issue if you are using the pen as a note jotter. For easy refilling on-the-go, Pilot's own cartridges can be used; for desk use, it is easy to refill the converter from an ink bottle.

All in all, a good pen for the money.

UPDATE, 8/15/14:
I bought a second one of these - Gunmetal finish, broad nib. This is one of only two fountain pen models of which I own two examples. (the other is the excellent and cheap Lamy Safari.) Compared to the medium nib, the broad is only slightly wider and is not as wide as a typical western broad (e.g., Sheaffer, Waterman). And the Pilot cartridges are the way to go: larger capacity than the converters and wonderful inks.";;
1749059567-36;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I really enjoy the pilot vanishing point. I have the broad point and the ink flows well, the pen does not scratch the paper and you can use reverse writing for a fine point feel. The click mechanism is satisfying and smooth. The pen has not dried out either which is nice. It’s a very classy pen and I’d buy another if I ever needed to.;;
1749059567-37;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I've ordered so many fountain pens because I didn't want to spend so much money at once.  If I added the cost of those pens, I could have purchased 2 vanishing point pens.  This pen is worth every single cent.  I'm saving for my next one so I can keep one in my purse and one for work.  It writes so beautifully.  Not one issue and it is a nice fine print.  Love it.;;
1749059567-38;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Wow I love this pen. I’ve wanted one for a long time but didn’t know what size nib to get. I went with the fine because I usually like European extra fines. Japanese pens (Pilot) run smaller than European sizes. The fine is a little bit finer than I thought it would be based on pictures I saw online but I still love it. The extra fine would have definitely been too fine for me. The gold nib is super smooth.

For the people saying that they didn’t get a “Vanishing Point” but a “Capless”, the rest of the world sells this pen as the “Capless”. It is still a gold nib “Vanishing Point”. The “Capless Special Alloy” is the one with a steel nib and usually run about $80. For the record mine came in a box that says Vanishing Point.

Update: So I ended up ordering a second one in matte black extra fine. I really wanted to try the extra fine out as I’ve come to like a finer line for neat, clean looking writing. I love the extra fine and have used it more than my fine. But the EF does have considerably more feedback. It takes a few days of writing to get use to it. But I love both and have had zero issues with them.

I’ve seen some people call the retractable nib “gimmicky”. I disagree. I use my VPs much more than my other FP as it’s so much easier to click the nib out than unscrew a cap and screw it back on. I use it at work all the time as well as home. The only issue I can agree with is small ink capacity. However, this doesn’t bother me too much as I just refill the converter with an ink syringe once a week or so.";;
1749059567-39;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I have a small mountain pen collection. I wish I would have bought this pen first. This would have been my only fountain pen. I use this everyday, for everything. Journaling, work meetings.

All black pen, so sexy pen
You can tell the pen is made from high quality materials.
But the ability to just click the pen, and begin/stop the writing process, protect the gold plated nib, with just a click, wonderful.

The most practical pen for me. If this one ever breaks, I will buy another one.";;
1749059567-40;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I think this is my new favorite pen for taking general work notes and reminders for myself. Among fountain pens there are certain ones which seem to have no direct completion. This one and the Platinum 3776 (which makes using carbon black ink practical), for example. This Med VP is the smoothest writing pen I've ever used, except for the Uniball Jetstream, which isn't a fountain pen anyway. Some people might feel that springy nibs are smoother, however. I'm not a big fan of the Pilot cartridge black because it's more of a watery dark grey. I'm using Aurora Black with the converter, which doesn't hold much ink. I went to Baltimore Pen show (2020) and tried out lots and lots of pens, but this one is the only one that I didn't already have in my small collection that shouted ""I'm way different!"" Since nothing had price tags I asked how much. I was testing a gorgeous light blue metallic model. When he said $150, I thought, think and read about this first. So, I did and then bought one here, but not the blue metallic which seems to be sold out everywhere so I went for this blue matte. Very pretty. I've read about the finish so I'm protecting it. I read the fine is not as smooth as the medium. so I got medium. The line is a scosh wider than what I think is perfect, but that's OK. Why so expensive? Well, the guts and nib inside which are very tiny and removable, to fill it, are $75 to replace as a part. So, the price has to start somewhere above that.";;
1749059567-41;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I have the Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen in red with gold trim, <B> 18k nib.  It wrote immediately out of the box upon inking.  It writes very smoothly and reliably.  It is handy at work for taking notes standing, when dealing with a cap would be awkward, but also is a pleasure for long writing sessions at the desk.  I'm delighted with the pen.  I will say that although Japanese nib sizes tend to leave a thinner line than their Western or Chinese counterparts, this broad nib leaves as broad a line as any other.;;
1749059567-42;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Unfortunatley I had to return the first one I received. The replacement is in transit. I LOVE the design, I love how practical it is. Who does not value a fountain pen that you can use  as a ball point? And this one is beautifull! The problem was it was too dry and I dared not do anything I was advised to do to increase the ink flow.  It worked well on the down strokes but not on the upstrokes. So, some letters could not be read.  Several people on the  fountain pen network had reported this symptom, but others are raving at the ink flow of the pens they have received. I will update this when I receive the replacement that so quickly AMAZON is sending, even before the UPS has picked up the non-working pen. Please look at the test writing for the problem. Maybe people with better knowledge of fountain pens could have fixed this, but I don't think it is my job to  tweek the pen. That would be tampering.  A 3 rate is  for design, workmanship and looks. The rest is to be seen and I will update next time i try the new replacement.

UpDATE:

After using the replacement for a for a month I can say that if your pen writes well, this is the most practical fountain pen in the world. The second pen I received skipped as well, but not as much, so I decided to keep it, although I was not satisfied with the buy.

I decided to fix the problem myself and by reading lots of references and tutorials, and changing the ink to Noodler's Oxblood and Black (I was using Diamine)  I was able to increase the flow. I also opened the tines with a  brass sheet.  None of these measures were aggressively pursued to keep risks at minimum, but finally i was able to say that it was close to being called a ""very good"" fountain pen.

NEXT PROBLEM surfaced after  a month with the second VP. The clip fell off!, just like that. No warning. I inserted it back and consulted with users and it seems it is a current problem. People are fixing it with ""G-S Hypo Cement"". I am still waiting for my cement to glue it back permanently. If I find anything else I will update the review. I still think if you are willing to fix it and put up with its defects , is a daily carrier and worth the risk. Should be priced lower for this, IMHO.";;
1749059567-43;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I just bought my second Vanishing Point Fountain Pen. I have one in matte black that I got about 15 years ago. I loved it then and always wanted to get more. I just was unable to get one tell now. I was really happy to see this new pen come in the mail the very next day from the time I placed my order. Upon opening the packaging I could see that Amazon had packed everything together and I really liked that. I also was really happy that the box the pen came in was not damaged or crushed in anyway.

I proceeded to open the box the the Vanishing point pen was in and saw that it was much thicker then the Vanishing point that I have. I did not know if I was going to like this, but now that I have used it for almost a 3days now, I love it. It writes amazing, the Pilot Mixable Colour ink refills are wonderful in the pen even thou the packaging states it is for the Parallel Calligraphy Pens. I have not had any problems with the ink leaking or clogging up the nib on the fountain pen. Like I said I have only been using my new pen for 3 days now.

In a week or two I will post again.

I wanted to give you all an update on what I have learned from Pilot. They said, We recommend the use of our Namiki/Pilot ink to refill your pen. Its exclusive formula ensures proper long-term functioning of your writing instruments.  Other brands can damage and prevent the proper functionality of your pen, which inhibits your writing experience and voids your warranty.

With that I am still going to use the Pilot Mixable Colour in refills in my pen. So far they have been great. But I am doing what I feel is right for me and if you don't want to void your warranty then don't use them.";;
1749059567-44;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I ordered this as I was looking for my next long-term fountain pen. Somebody recommended this one to me, so I decided to take the plunge and check it out.

I am extremely impressed with the pen's build quality. I have the black matte one, so it feels very sturdy, assuring, and comfortable. I know there's a clip down the barrel, but because of the way I hold my pen, I actually don't find it uncomfortable whatsoever. It feels perfectly fine for me when I write with it. I especially like how the clip is in a different place so the pen will be aiming upward whenever you have it clipped away in a pocket or something. I also like the added value of how the pen comes included with an ink converter, so if you have any ink lying around, you can load it up manually.

The pen is extremely versatile and portable. I carry it around regularly with my pocket notebook (a grid-dotted Leuchtturm1917), and I find that it works extremely well. Alongside that, I use it with another couple of notebooks. One is a CR Gibson journal that I use for organizing ideas for my stories and novels, and another is some off-brand notebook I use for studying other languages. It works well with all the paper that I've tried it on, with the exception of modern Moleskine paper. Of course, that's the fault of Moleskine themselves and not the manufacturers of this pen.

The pen feels quite sturdy, and I can say if you want a long-term fountain pen you can use for years to come, you will get an excellent value with this one. The best part for me is that I seriously feel like this pen makes me want to find excuses to use it. It just feels that excellent.";;
1749059567-45;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"There are many things to love about this pen, and a few that should be improved on.

Firstly, the most important question, ""does this pen write well?"" And the answer is yes! Very beautifully! This pen's writing abilities is amazing! It would be comparable to sliding a hot knife across butter, it's that smooth. And while it isn't a flex nib at all, you'll be surprised that it can give a little of a bounce to writing.
Also, who this pen is for is someone who wants to write on the go or do note-taking. With a fountain pen that doesn't need a cap to have to constantly post and recap, writing is super streamlined. Just pop it out, click the pen, write, and reclick, and you're all good to go.
Also, the pen itself is gorgeous to look at. I got the Blue with gold accents, and when I first took the pen out of the case, I marveled at it's beauty.

Now, here's what needs to be looked at. First, the Pilot converters are small. The pen will give you a good amount of ink to write with using a converter, to my taste, it should still be more. Cartridges are perfect at ink capacity for this pen.

Also, the click plunger gets scratched to all hell after a day's the first time. Because it's so long (the nib unit needs to be pushed a long distance) the scratches can be really lengthy, and a bit noticeable.

Would I recommend this pen? Absolutely, despite the few gripes I have about it. It really is a fantastic pen to write with, a joy to have around, and it's potability with the click mechanism is unmatched.";;
1749059567-46;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I seem to have inadvertently become a pen collector--nothing too esoteric, mind you, just sleek, smooth-writing pen that balance well in the hand, please the eye, & work well where paper meets ink. The Namiki Vanishing Point does all of this & more. Its 18k nib is glorious; I love writing with it.  Fyi, tho, the ""fine"" nib runs a bit toward ""extra fine,"" by American & European standards, and so on with the other available nibs. Also, one of the reasons I may have had such a smooth go of it is, I think, because I recently discovered Iroshizuku ink, made by Namiki, which is the slickest (literally), prettiest ink I've ever used--& is certainly the ink made for Namiki pens. All in all it is a blissful experience. I love the sleek look; I love the way the writing instrument rests in my hand; I love the way it lays ink on the paper. & its packaging! What a hoot. I was tempted to keep the pen in its ""box"" as display. But I ended up using its ""box"" as a picture frame.  Best pen packaging ever!  This modern, innovative pen is a winner. Or at least it is one of my faves in my own growing collection.  Hope your experience is as positive as mine.

I have owned this pen two months now & come back to add, I still love this fountain pen.  The vanishing point mechanism that seals the nib away when you aren't using it protects the ink from drying out well.  My pen has never missed starting right up, even after a couple days of no use.  And the pen's reservoir must be decent sized.  I am still writing with the ink I put in 2 months ago, while I have had to refill every converter in my rotation of pens in the same period.";;
1749059567-47;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This pen writes very well. It took a few weeks to feel as smooth as I expected, but after a short time it feels so smooth with Irishizuku black.

The fine is not quite as fine as I wanted, but writes extremely well. The ef is a tad too fine and often feels a little scratchy. For this reason while I prefer for the ef or vf nib in the Metropolitan, in the vanishing point the f is the way to go. The M is waaay larger, like 2 steps larger.

The two negatives would be small converter capacity, and the matte black clip scratches easily. It scratched literally the first day I carried it in a pocket- and doesn't touch up easily. The gloss finish seems more durable.
The small capacity is really small. Expect to refill every 4 full pages of writing.  With the ef nib I still need to refill almost weekly. I keep 2 pens in my bag just in case I ever run short on ink, but if that's a concern I'd use cartridges.

The 18k gold nib has a nice springy feeling, while giving a crisp line. The pen feels solid and hasn't leaked on me so far. Overall if you don't need the mechanism I'd buy a metropolitan to save money, otherwise you get what you'd expect in quality with Pilot.";;
1749059567-48;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;The ability to extend and retract the nib with the ease of any ballpoint retractable is what makes this fountain pen so amazing for me. It makes writing with a fountain pen easy. I do not have to worry about taking the time to unscrew a cap, not lose the cap, worry about the cap falling off and causing a leak in my pocket. As far as leaks are concerned, this pen has not leaked an iota. I also own a Namiki Bamboo, which is also a great pen but it not conducive to day-to-day use since A) the cap is screw on/off and B) it leaks. This pen also weighs far less than my Namiki, though it does weight more than a comparatively sized ballpoint or felt tip. This is my go-to fountain pen. Sleek, stylish, and painfully easy to use. People don't even notice that I'm using a fountain pen - it's in and out that quickly and easily. The nib is stiff enough to give a dependable line, but flexible enough to not scratch up the paper I'm writing on. I've even managed to write on one of those cheap fast-food restaurant paper napkins with this pen. However, I will admit to being a bit too cavalier with the pen, as easy to use as it is. I have dropped the pen while the nib was exposed and this has bent it quite badly, however I have been able to bend it back into usable shape. If you are clumsy and careless like I apparently am, this may not be the pen for you since you will mourn for this pen. If you are careful enough to not drop the pen while the nib is exposed, this pen will make you very happy indeed.;;
1749059567-49;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;This thing came and had a tag (Capless). After looking up multiple sources, it's VP. It's not Decimo for sure. Also I had a great price on this item (depending on the color and the nib option)! I read so much about this pen but wasn't so sure until I used them. The nib was so thin and small. It says 18K though it's impossibly small to read it with bare eyes. It has a heft and the holder is fine for my taste. This is all about the nib (bought Fine). I have 3 other high end Pilot pens so I have something to compare to. VP nib is very very smooth (like 823) yet so thin that it bounces beautifully. I'm not big on the nib variation but this springy and bouncy feel especially on such a thin nib is totally different experience for me. I now understand why people fall in love with this pen. Downside? There's no way to read the ink level. Though converter (that's built in) has a clear window, no matter what you do, the ink level won't show. So when it feels dry and ink doesn't flow as well, then, it's time to change. For me it was about 3-4 pages of casual writing on the legal pad. That's not whole a lot to write with. But on a very fine day, this fine pen will boost your mood. Trust me. It's a pen like no other. I may shoot for 2017 special.;;
1749059567-50;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"A fountain pen that's retractable is a pretty novel idea, and is the main selling point of the Pilot Vanishing Point.

The enlarged button atop the body alternates between revealing and retracting the narrow steel nib within.  The nib itself has a bulbous tip that's a nod at its ballpoint inspiration.  It's smooth and pleasant to write with.

I think the matte blue barrel paired with black details and trim is pretty classy.  The body and overall construction is metal and it feels solid and and well-made.  It unscrews in the middle allowing you to remove the convertor and nib assembly for filling- again, more similar to retractable pen than fountain pen.  Not having a cap to post, the clip is near the nib and makes it feel like you're writing with a pen that has a dorsal fin.  A little awkward, but not a deal breaker, and it keeps the nib pointing upward when clipped onto a pocket, etc.

Mine had some issues filling properly.  Tried submerging the entire black portion of the nib- which is a challenge since it's longer than most ink bottles are deep.  Replaced the converter.  Twice.  Still can't managed to fill the reservoir more than 15% or so.  It's probably a rare defect, but I don't like it enough to even bother with a replacement.

Tries to be the best of both worlds, but instead ends up with few of the advantages and most of the disadvantages of both.";;
1749059567-51;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I have this pen, fine nib, in three finishes that I rotate.  This is my go-to every day writing pen.  I like everything about it: the convenience of the retractable mechanism, the flexible nib, the fine low-bleed writing, the weight and balance in my hand.;;
1749059567-52;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This is the most expensive pen I have ever owned, but it is also the best quality pen I have ever owned.
My handwriting is fairly small and anything but an extra fine nib allows the letters to run together.  This nib is actually one of the  best extra fine nibs I have found since it writes finer than most extra fine nibs.  I am currently using a carbon ink in it with wonderful results.  It starts writing with minimal or no strokes to get it started.  There are no problems with it skipping and this is a very smooth writing instrument. It glides over the paper (and quite a variety of papers at that) without scratching.  The retractable nib is extremely handy and so far has never allowed the pen to dry out.
It can be used either with cartridges or the included reservoir/ converter.  Some commenters have mentioned that the reservoir is fairly small.  I really have nothing much to compare to, but it holds plenty for my needs.
I really like this pen.  I can't afford to buy another, but neither do I want any other pen than this.";;
1749059567-53;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This is my first retractable fountain pen, and well worth the investment.
The tank is a little small for heavy use, but perfect for signing documents , etc, during the week.
Takes some getting used to, as it looks like I'm using the pen upside down.
Ink flow is great, just the right amount of feedback on the page for me, but my husband finds it too slick.";;
1749059567-54;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Consumer bias aside, I love the weight, feel, and look of this pen so much!

The sleek matte black of the pen makes it look so professional. I like the clip on the top/writing side because my fingers form perfectly right around it, the clickability of the pen makes writing a one-handed process (no capping or uncapping required), and it's the perfect size for my hand. The weight of the pen makes writing so enjoyable - in comparison, the Sailor Pro Gear Slim feels like a light toy.

My only qualm is that the converter that comes with the pen has a very low ink capacity. There are videos out there on how to get the most ink in the converter... but what I do instead is just fill up a cartridge with my favorite ink. It lasts much longer and is actually much less of a hassle than trying to fully fill the converter.";;
1749059567-55;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This is a very nice pen, I would recommend getting it the fin nib just as the other reviews stated the writing would look more like the one with medium nib.

The pen is very clean and applies always same amount of ink, the writing is smooth and comfortable, and the pen also has some weight in it and settles very nicely into the hand.

The pen needs high quality paper where the writing will look almost fine and there will be no penetration to the reverse side of the page even if you write slowly as I do. on the other hand on paper such is the usual printer/Xerox paper the ink may not look quite as nice, while it does not ""feather"" the writing will look thicker.

I really really recommend getting the ink bottle from namaki and use the converter for your pen, the sole reason being that in my pen the converter was inserted so firmly into the nib unit that I was almost inclined to leave it alone and not use cartridge at all, as I was not sure how resilient the nib unit is. There is another reason as well the protrusion that is ment to brake the seal on the cartridge seemed to be plastic, while I would expect this part to be one of the strongest in the unit and made of high grade steel or equivalent, one again I cannot say for 100% but it really did look like plastic. Once I am out of cartridges I will get namaki cerulean blue ink and use that with converter.";;
1749059567-56;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"A gorgeous, functional everyday pen that is a bargain!  I always wanted a quality fountain pen without paying $1000+.  This one is perfect because:

1.  No screw-on cap.  No more fussing with a cap with both hands when looking for a pen to write with.  The pen opening has a little door that opens and closes, keeping the nib from drying out

2.  Pen is clipped with the nib pointing up.  No more little pen marks in my shirt pocket that even ball point pens can leave.

3.  Can be converted from piston filler to cartridge without problems.

4.  18K gold plated nib, long lasting, and looks great

However, I was a little disappointed that the design ""Carbonesque"" is actually just regular plastic with little dots painted on it.  Not the true carbon fiber look.  Also, when using a cartridge, it can take a long time for the ink to make its way to the tip.  Also when not used for a few hours, the ink at the tip dries and it takes about 15-20 seconds to prime the tip again.  A little annoying when you need to write something fast, like a phone number.

Overall, it's worth the $130 I paid for it.  I do agree that the medium tip should be used by most people for everyday use.  I got the fine tip and kinda regret it because with my handwriting, some of my lines are too thin and not very visible.";;
1749059567-57;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Really love almost everything about the pen itself. The box was decent but i will say i feel somewhat cheated. The ""Fine Writing"" nib is not a fine nib. What i in turn received was a Medium Nib. That all being said i do enjoy the pen but i wish i had gotten what i had ordered.";;
1749059567-58;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I have used inexpensive Pilot fountain pens for years.  They are sturdy, easy to hold, and write well.  I have never had one fail; but I do tend to leave them behind at restaurants or forget to retrieve them from people who have borrowed them ""just for a second.""

When I saw a listing for this product I thought it was unique enough to give it a try.  I'm very happy I did.  The design of the pen is upside down; that is when in my shirt pocket the nib (nestled within the body of the pen) faces up.  Once I got the hang of that, it was an issue holding the pen (I'm left-handed) so that the nib was facing the page while the clip was out of the way.

The reality is:  The designers thought of this and, while I don't know how it works for righties; for lefties it is just fine.

The additional cost is well worth it.  The tiny nib writes far more easily than the budget Pilot, the mechanism hiding the nib works smoothly, and it didn't suffer from going with me on an airplane.

If I didn't own this pen, I would order one today.";;
1749059567-59;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Ordered the pen in Matte Black with a Fine nib, received a Matte Blue with a Stub nib. Not really the fault of the seller, since the Pilot box states clearly that it contains a blue pen, whereas the Amazon sticker mistakenly labels it ""Black"".

Anyway, the pen itself is pleasant to use. I'll admit that the price point may be a little steep for the overall novelty, but I know what I paid for and I paid for a retractable fountain pen. The pen has a nice weight (for me), and I don't really mind the positioning of the pocket clip as I find it helps me align the nib without having to look. I could definitely see where some people might not like it, but in my hand it feels just fine.

Same general complaints as some other reviewers, however. The converter doesn't hold a massive volume of ink, and due to the construction of the pen it's just about the largest you could fit in it already so, not much to do outside of switch to cartridges. There is also some difficulty loading the thing up: when dipping into the ink, no matter how deep the pen goes, the converter only ever seems to pick up about 1/3rd of its total volume. This led to a few confused fill attempts where it looked like the pen wasn't picking anything up, but when inverted and given a small shake you see the ink fall down into the empty space.

Overall: A decent pen, if slightly more expensive than it should've been, with some small issues. My biggest complaint is that I didn't get the color or nib I ordered, which now means I need to buy a $90 nib assembly because there's no way to just swap the nib without it. But again: That's not the fault of the pen.";;
1749059567-60;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Pilot Vanishing Point in Black lacquer with rhodium trim. Extra Fine nib.:
SIMPLY A GREAT PEN
Laquer coated brass body feels well balanced and solid, but not heavy,  Click-to-write  mechanism is efficient, fast, foolproof.
A flick of your thumb and the  Vanishing Point  generates a  “click” that’s audible and tactile, while deploying the hidden nib. Your fingers, naturally aligns  with the pocket clip and nib in the perfect position to jot quick notes without even needing to glance at the page.  Rhodium accents and nib coating paired with a piano black lacquer body create a look that’s  classic, elegant, and understated while also being modern and eye-catching.
 Ink never fails to flow smoothly and keeps up even with fast, lengthy note taking. Extra Fine nib in rhodium plated 14k gold is smooth, with a pleasant touch of feedback, and a variation of line that’s surprising for such a tiny, precise nib.
MY ONLY COMPLAINT?- the provided Pilot Con 40
Converter’s ink capacity is minuscule to the point that  I almost prefer cartridges— almost.
Still, the pen is highly recommend!";;
1749059567-61;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I definitely really enjoyed this pen. I've collected a few different fountain pens, including some of the more economical Pilot ones but the vanishing point is definitely top tier. It's a much lighter flow with a weighting pen that gives more of an executive feel. Would highly recommend!;;
1749059567-62;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;(Make sure you get one that’s actually new and hasn’t been inked!!) I finally got one that was brand new and undamaged after buying one that had its nib bent and one that had clearly been inked and the nib was loose, and it’s amazing!! The finish and details are perfectly uniform and I love it. The nib is soooooo smooth!!!!! I’m rather new to fountain pens and had used a Pilot Prera before this and I didn’t really get the hype behind 18k nibs, but WOW this one did not miss. I get it now, guys. It’s amazing. Get this and don’t look back :);;
1749059567-63;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;This pen is a bit of a novelty, but a  excellent writer. I opted for a fine niv, which seems well matched for the ink capacity of the CON-40 converter. Contrary to other reviewers, I found the fine nib to be quite wet with Diamine Regency Blue, and typical for a Japanese fine width. The nib has a surprising amount of spring for such a small nib, and is very, very smooth. The CON-40 converter  is difficult to fill completely without burping it or removing it from the nib assembly. It might be best to fill the converter or an empty cartridge with a syringe or disposable pipette to get maximum ink capacity. With an EF or F nib, the capacity of the converter should be quite adequate. The clip is less of a nuisance for gripping the pen than I imagined. With the F or EF nib, there is minimal feathering on copy quality paper with Diamine inks. The Blue/Gold model is quite handsome. Well worth adding to any well-used fountain pen collection.;;
1749059567-64;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"It's really, really nice. Keep in mind the ink that this pen comes with is blue. For whatever reason I thought it would be black and now I have to run the blue dry before I switch. I guess I could just replace it, but I don't really want to. This is my EDC because my Prera Ito En apparently leaks all over my hand due to how I write. This one doesn't have that issue because the nib is further from my hand since it's also ""inside"" the pen. That doesn't make sense, but oh well. It's a bit heavy, but it doesn't hurt my hand after writing with it. The ink flows nicely, and my only complaint is that I feel like I'm using it wrong, but that's just me being bad.

I also dropped it on accident, but the nib was inside the pen, so it doesn't look like any damage occurred. There was a bit of ink splotched over the nib, though, so I wiped it off. Once I got used to the clip being at the tip, it wasn't so bad. It's also really easy to align the pen since I like to move objects in my hands a lot.";;
1749059567-65;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"After using this for awhile I'm not very pleased with the ink flow. I frequently have ink starvation, to the tune of every few words at least not even writing that quickly.Have used several different quality inks including the Pilot cartridges and Iroshizuku Shin-Kai, Noodlers and Parker. It's definitely much scratchier than my basic Lamy Safari Fine or Watermans and is just not a satisfying writer to me. Have asked several friends to try it and all have said they find it disappointing too but they are not regular fountain pen users.

Update: It seems the nib was bending downward a bit - a local shop adjusted it, makes a huge difference. Prior to the adjustment the nib was completely dry on the top surface, no ink at all on your finger if you touched it. Now there is just a trace of ink on top of the nib while writing. They did not grind it and simply applied a tiny bit of pressure at the nib tines. Wow, huge difference! It is now the pen I expected though still more of an extra fine it feels vastly improved. Still deciding between a medium and fine nib, it's a tough call but either would be great to use now.";;
1749059567-66;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I have had countless pens over the years and this is by far my favorite. The retractable feature is great for taking notes on the fly. The converter is not my favorite, so I use the Namiki refills and will use a syringe to refill the cartridges - that way I get the largest reservoir of ink. The nib is buttery soft (I purchased M, F may be prone to more feedback). There is no sweet spot - the pen responds to whatever style of writing I wish to employ. I wish the price point was a bit lower, but I believe under $160 is a great value. Make the plunge, you won't regret it!;;

""Wow, that's quite a fancy pen,"" ""you're one high speed guy,"" and ""are you writing the next great novel?"" are just some of the responses you might hear while carrying and using this pen in the military.

The device itself writes absolutely brilliantly.Even in fine, you have smooth wet lines (I used Pilot Iroshizuku ink) that express lines with enough give to make you write for hours. Remember this is a fountain pen and has the same shortcomings such as taking a little bit of time to dry for example. The great design of the pen however allows you to have the convenience of conventional retractable pens.

The pen is priced at a steal as I would price this pen based on its qualities much higher. If you have never owned a fountain pen, this is a great place to start as your first. If you have more than 7 fountain pens, the unique design and convenience that this pen offers you at the price point makes me wonder why you haven't already bought it.";;

Both the 74 and 92 have major issues with this however my fine nibbed vanishing point writes perfectly in every direction.  It is truely a pleasure to write with and i intend to order more so i have them anywhere i may feel the need to write... if you are just starting out with fountain pens, and you are a lefty, you can not go wrong with this pen!

Three footnotes:

1.) There are two varieties: the original Vanishing Point, and the Decimo. The original VP is a little larger and a little heavier (which I like). The Decimo comes in some cool, non-traditional colors. Mine is a black and gold VP.

2.) There is an extra fine point option. I bit on that the first time, but found the nib to be too scratchy on toothier papers. My pen is a fine point. I love it.

3.) This pen can be a little difficult to refill, as it requires a mostly-full ink well. Hack: get one of the 1 mL oral medicine syringes that come with your kid’s (or your friends’ kid’s) medicine, remove the adapter from the nib, and refill directly. Works beautifully, and is less messy than the prescribed refilling method.";;
1749059567-70;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I've owned one of these for more than 20 years, but in a boring black and scuffed up from years of use (and under the Namiki brand name, which is Pilot's premium brand). The old one still writes perfectly, but when I saw the this blue/gold beauty at a fountain pen show, and knew I had to have it. I prefer to use a fountain pen and the 'clickability' of these makes them as quick and simple to use as a ballpoint. Writes smoothly and superbly and feels good in the hand. It's a substantial pen but not heavy, you can feel and see the quality -- everything just works! The Pilot ink cartridges are easy to find and cheap.

Note that this is Pilot's ""Vanishing Point"" line. They offer slightly smaller versions in their ""Decimo"" line, which are functionally identical. And I've never had any kind of leakage problem; Pilot's system just works and they don't dry out.

Bottom line, if you like writing with fountain pens, you will love these pens! Write well and are attention-getters!";;
1749059567-71;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This review is likely biased because I am a total fanboy of Pilot fountain pens. I've used and own just about all them - Varsity, Metropolitan, Falcon, also now also the Vanishing Point.

So I am sure the average person is wondering, is a retractable fountain pen a gimmick? No it is not. Simply put - it puts a classy, yet modern touch, on something considered dated and traditional. The look and feel is amazing. Users the use fountain pens typically made from resin may find the pen  on the heavy side, but it isn't so heavy that use of the pen would become tiresome. And the retracting mechanism is indescribable - it is perfectly weighted and absolutely satisfying each and every time you click it.

But none of the really matters right? It is a pen after all, it is meant to write. So I guess the big question would be 'How well does it write?'. Well, it writes just like any other premium fountain pen from Pilot. It writes like a traditional Japanese fountain pen (thin, not broad), but it exceptionally smooth, no doubt that the 14k rhodium plated gold nib as much to do with that.

Just make sure you keep this pen upright, and this will be the best writing instrument you've ever had!";;

I've had my own Namiki Vanishing Point Pen for about 3 years.  Whatever steps I can take to diminish the deluge of throw away things is meaningful to me.  I first bought this pen at a specialty pen shop in Carmel, for about $40 more than I paid for this one!  It writes smoothly, is comfortable in the hand, and the nib retracting, like a turtle into its shell, makes it so easy to use (nothing to uncap).  I've never had it leak.  If I have any 'problem' with it, it's that it only holds a fill-up for a couple of days of moderate use, rather than the week+ I'd been told it would.  There are cartridges for it if you prefer that approach (but for me, that's another throwaway).  However, my brother bought this same pen after trying mine, and he uses cartridges that he says last a couple of weeks of moderate use.  I did purchase a couple of packs of cartridges to send along with my daughter - not sure what she'd be able to find in Africa.

1749059567-73;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"As someone who is obsessed with quality writing utensils & paper goods, I wanted to love this pen so badly.  I really, really did.  Unfortunately I am unwilling to make so many compromises for a pen in this price range.

PROs:

- The convenience of a retractable fountain pen cannot be understated.  It's amazing when you need to take short notes or jot something down quickly.  No need to constantly cap and recap the pen.
- Aesthetically, the pen is absolutely gorgeous.  One of the most beautiful pens I've ever held.
- The pen has a nice even balance.  It's got some weight to it but it's not too heavy.
-  It's very easy to ink up and clean out.
- You can purchase additional ""nib units"" and quickly swap out nib size / color.

CONs:

- The pen clip.  I have never seen another pen with the clip located on the writing end, and for good reason.  My goodness, what a horrible idea.  It forces you into a certain hand position / writing style in order to get the nib on the paper correctly.  If, like me, you're used to holding your fingers in a relaxed position (rather than a ""tripod"" style), you will have a difficult time writing with this pen.
- Dry starts and skips.  I've used 2 different nibs (medium / bold) and 4 different inks in this pen (Noodler's Bulletproof Black, Iroshizuku Shin-Kai, Aurora Black, and the standard cartridge that came with it).  I have experienced dry starts and skips with every one of them.  Mostly on 'up' strokes, the pen will simply be too try to complete a line.  I flushed the feed numerous times to try and resolve this, but it remained an issue.
- Nib smoothness.  So many reviews I read said this nib was ""buttery smooth"", yet the medium is no smoother than a Pilot Metropolitan.  As far as the broad nib goes, I would venture to say that - side by side - my Lamy Al-Star with broad nib is actually a smoother / better writer, and it's much more comfortable to hold.
- Price.  As much as I love the convenience of the vanishing point, the pen itself is mediocre as far as fountain pens go.  Take away the retractable mechanism and this is a $20-30 pen with a pocket clip on the wrong end.

I was sad to return this product, but despite having extremely high hopes...I was very disappointed with it.  You can easily get a superior product for 1/3 the price.";;

Couple this with a nice ink (I recommend the Namiki, high grade ink made by the same company) and you've got a really nice writing utensil.

Two complaints:
1) the Medium nib, which I got, is a little flowy for me.  looking into getting a Fine nib.  This is personal preference though.  I suggest you find a local pen store and try each nib to see which you like best

Overall this pen is easy on the eyes. It's a sexy, sleek and modern. It has turned out to be one of my smoothest writers, right out of the box, and as many have said before me, quite practical for general writing purposes. Because of that, I automatically reach for this pen first now.

One thing that I will note, and maybe my eyes are just playing tricks on me is that the nib appears to be coated to be dark and match the overall look of the pen. The pictures associated with the black matte pen seem to show a regular (non coated) nib. I might have to order one of the ones that that specifically say: 18-karat gold nib with black-ion coating coordinates with pen accents to compare. The description for the matte black one just says: 18-karat gold rhodium-plated nib. Mine actually appears 'dark' and not like the picture which is 'light'.

This is my everyday go to pen. The clip and button makes it easy to use one handed. It is weighty and feels substantial in your hand. It is built like a tank, and has survived many falls.

This pen does have some minor cons: Its resevoir is puny. I would say I write over 5-6000 words on average everyday. And I have to refill this pen atleast 2 times during it. The nib on this pen also has some issues. It runs broader than medium. I found it too be too wet and too wide for my tastes, and I have had to order a the fine nib for myself.

Would I recommend this pen:Absolutely! This is one of the best fountain pens available out there. It is fairly unique, very utilitarian and made exceptionally well. I believe this pen should exist in every pen collector / fountain pen user's collection.";;

1749059567-80;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This is my second Vanishing Point pen.  My first was a fine nib, and I am very happy with it, but it didn't work very well on copy paper.  The paper required too much ink and the fine nib simply would't deliver enough.  The medium nib has no such issue.  Writing on copy paper is smooth as silk, and even better on my Moleskine planner.  The pen feels fantastic in the hand, the color is great, and Noodlers ink goes very well with the pen.

The retractable nib means you'll never lose a cap.  The pen writes immediately every time, so there's no drying problem due to no cap.  A small door closes when the nib is retracted keeping the nib safe and unexposed to air.

The pen comes with an ink cartridge and a reservoir for using with fountain pen ink.  The instructions for filling the reservoir aren't terribly clear, but it does work once you figure it out.  Drop the nib into the ink all the way up to the shaft so the shaft is partially submerged and twist the filler all the way closed then open.  It's a bit messy, so have some paper towels ready to clean up the nib and shaft.  Then go write something.  And enjoy every minute of writing.

If you're looking for a great fountain pen, this is it.";;
1749059567-81;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"A very nice pen.

If you’re new to fountain pens and you’ve done some research you’ve probably read that Japanese nib sizes are generally smaller or finer than their European counterparts (i.e. Japanese Medium ~= Euro Fine, Japanese Fine ~= Euro Extra Fine, etc.); this does not seem to be the case with this pen. I found the medium Vanishing Point to be what I’d expect of a Euro Medium; I found the Fine Vanishing Point to be about what I’d expect of a Euro Fine (slightly larger than a .5 gel roller). This is not a criticism but it’s certainly something a potential buyer should know. I started out with the Medium and exchanged it for the Fine because the Medium was just too large for my writing style which is on the smaller side (I typically use a .5 Ink Joy Gel pen at work).  I may need to go down to the Extra Fine, but I’m giving the Fine a shot.";;
1749059567-82;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I have been writing with fountain pens for the last 15 years and I've used it all, from vintage sheaffer to modern day Mont Blancs. Having said that,  this pen may not be for everyone in spite of my 5 star rating.

I love this pen. It has quickly become my favorite every day carry pen. The best features in my book are the 18k nib for this price,  the ability to switch out nib units on a whim and the ability to retract the nib as I brainstorm.  The potentially problematic areas include the clip being in your way while you write - I had to change my grip slightly but I use the clip in my favor now by adjusting my grip position relative to the clip. It works for me, but may not work for everyone. The pilot nib in fine started out slightly scratchy for me - it's an extremely fine nib akin to other Japanese fines, but it smoothened itself out quite nicely after a few pages of writing.

So if you're thinking of falling in love with it right out of the box, that may not happen. But give it some time and you'll really fall hard for this smooth writer. That's my story anyways. Cheers";;
1749059567-83;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This is the second matte black vanishing point pen I've bought - my puppy got a hold of the first one and hid it somewhere and none of my other fountain pens can even come close in comparison to this pen. I've read about complaints re the matte surface scratching, but I have had no problems with this. My favorite thing about this pen is - no cap! One less thing to lose, one less thing to hunt for under a dark table. The matte finish looks super cool, the nib is smooth with good glide on regular paper (I got an xtra fine nib), the ""vanishing"" portion of the pen keeps the nib safe, and the clip stores the pen upside down so less chance of an ink mishap. Also, this pen comes with a cartridge adapter, which is what I use.";;
1749059567-84;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I am extremely happy with this pen. It writes incredibly smoothly and fits comfortably in my hand. This is only my second fountain pen and I originally bought the medium nib based on other reviewer comments. However, I found that it wrote too thick of a line and returned it for a fine nib. That is perfect. I can't see anyone having a problem with using a fine point, even if they are relatively new to fountain pens.

I also wasn't sure I'd like the clip on the end of the pen. I thought it might get in the way of my fingers when I wrote. But, to the contrary, it allows me to grab the pen and position it in my hand in the perfect position to write with the nib pointing in the right way.

The pen is gorgeous. I got the blue carbonesque and it really looks nice.

Finally, I love the fact that it is retractable. I have noticed that when I leave the pen open, the ink dries out a bit, but if I retract it before setting it down, the ink flows perfectly the next time I pick it up to use it.

This is more than I normally would think to spend on a pen, but I don't regret it one bit. Very happy with the purchase.";;
1749059567-85;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I have quite a few fountains pens, from my expensive Mont Blanc to my less expensive ""Preppy"" plastic model.  Previously (believe it or not) the plastic-bodied Preppy has been my workhorse, with the smoothest flow and nib on any pen I've used.  Not bad for a $10 pen.  However, the plastic body breaks down fast, and the point is too broad.

I'd been reading about the Vanishing Point for quite a while, and I finally managed to pick this one up.  All I can say is WOW.  This is finest point I've ever written with.  The lines are EXTREMELY thin, and the nib is pretty smooth.  It's not as smooth as my Preppy (or my Rapidograph), but it's pretty smooth, and the feel of it is nice and substantial, like a good pen should be, without being too grossly heavy.  I've used the cartridge (Pilot Namiki brand) and the convertor (with Noodler's Bulletproof Black) and both work equally well.  I did about 9 pages of longhand with the convertor, though, and it sucked the convertor dry, so keep your ink handy if you write a lot.

The contours are also well-done, with the pocketclip having small depressions for your fingertips while holding it, and the guts are very well-built.

Extremely good value in this pen.";;
1749059567-86;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I absolutely LOVE the spectacular stub nib for this pen!

Like Pilot's great Fude nib you can adjust line width by tilting the pen. Holding the pen vertically gets you a fine italic, hold it at 60 degrees and you get a medium italic!!!

Additionally this gold nib, small as it is, is springy and gives you a lot of expressive width changes with gentle changes in pressure.

The mechanism seems well sorted and reliable.

The pen is stealth to the max, and only fountain pen junkies will give it a second look, which is fine with me. It is the secret handshake of our clandestine family.

A medium wet very smooth writer, and not a terrible deal for a 18K gold nib pen (the nib is also stealth in mat black!)

Thinking of a retractable, but in love with stubs?

Your pen has arrived!";;
1749059567-87;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I love this pen, only reason I'm giving a 4/5 is because it feels alittle heavy in your hand, and where the clip is at almost makes you have to hold it a certain way. I love the fine point because I tend to write small, and I love the sound the nib makes on paper when you are writting. If they could lighten it up just a touch I would give 5/5 all day;;
1749059567-88;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I have numerous fountain pens for writing in my journals.  This one is the one I always seem to look for when it's time to write some mothereffing feelings or ideas down.  This pen, with a standard converter, accompanied by some Noodler's Heart of Darkness black ink, and used upon a sturdy Blue Line notebook, and I can't go back to any other combination.  My poor Lamy collection watches me with contempt every time I pass by their case, and I can hear them consoling each other in the middle of the night when they think no one is listening.  This pen has me wanting to just waste more money on getting the same pen in different colors, it writes so smooth and easy.  I like a smaller line, so I use a Fine, but this is kind of like a medium/fine in my opinion, which is just about right for my taste.  I've gone weeks without using it, and when I put it to paper, its primed and ready upon the first stroke.  Get yourself one of these.  You'll like it.  Just don't take it to work and waste it on job stuff.  Use it to actually write something personal on some good paper and you won't feel cheated.;;
1749059567-89;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;Simple review, the fit and finish are 2nd to none. The detailed engineering, that went into the use of this pen, make it user friendly from refills to writing with the pen. To me it is priced, very justifiable for the advanced fountain pen your are receiving. Do yourself a favor and purchase this pen, with the pilot brand refill bottle. Even the bottle is filled with just enough ink to lightly rest your pen tip on bottom for a clean refill. Plus the ink is incredibly fast to dry and maintains a deep color. I purchased 2 of these pens, and both were flawless. The packaging was very detailed, so the look and quality feel of the packaging match the quality of the pen. I write on the small side, but pretty neat do to private school IMHO. So I found the fine tip to be the perfect size line width, for all my writing needs from documents to journals to greeting cards. I hope the review helps you. God bless all of us.;;

1749059567-91;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Update: I decided to buy another girl pen, the extra fine bib and the fine nib. (See picture). I love the fine bib. It flows great and gives you clean ink across the page. The extra fine gets snagged on the paper. I like how thin the ink flows but it literally drags across the paper.

I am a lefty and this is my first fountain pen. I absolutely love it. It is smooth but also allows me to change the position of writing when my hand gets tired. I can write at an almost 90 degree angle to a 45 degree angle and the ink continues to flow. The clip allows me to rest my pointer finger comfortably. I have a tendency to use a lot of pressure to write and this pen makes it so I can use a light pressure. I’m curious what the other nibs feel like. I ordered a fine point.";;
1749059567-92;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;Great writer.  I love medium nibs and this didn't disappoint.  The clip on the end doesn't bother me at all while I'm writing, but I wouldn't use this long writing.  I take a lot of pleasure knowing the Pilot Vanishing Point nib units are interchangeable with other Pilot capless pens.  Also, it comes with a blue ink cartridge, and converter.  Matte black look has that professional look, too.;;
1749059567-93;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;In case you were wondering like I was, I asked what nib does “fine writing” refer to.

1749059567-94;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Although I own quite a few fountain pens, this is my first $100+ pen purchase. I was nervous to spend so much on a pen, but after drooling over this pen for so long and reading all of the wonderful reviews I decided to go for it.  I am so glad I did!  The quality of this pen compared to my others is amazing. (You truly do get what you pay for.)

I decided to purchase the medium nib because I do not like the scratchy feeling you sometimes get with finer nibs.  It's perfect for me - very smooth on the paper, and it distributes just the right amount of ink.  The retractable feature is wonderful. With a satisfying click, my nib is put away and protected. I also like the placement of the pen clip because it guides my fingers into perfect writing position.  It just ""feels right"".

Whether you are a newbie or a veteran fine pen purchaser, you will not be disappointed with this pen. It is such a joy to write with and a quality instrument.";;
1749059567-95;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I have two of these and they are great daily writers due to the convenience of not having to handle a cap. it does not look very elegant like other famous brands of fountain pens. nevertheless, I like the utilitarian look. the strange way of holding on to the clip doesn't bother me.

I have both the medium and broad nips. they both are very ""wet"" nips. very smooth gliding on even the cheap Xerox papers when the right ink is used. I have always used bottled ink.

I noticed that they work best with the pilot ink, especially with the Iroshizuku line. aurora, waterman, and diamine bottled ink work well as well. However, I don't have luck with Noodler's indelible ink with the pilot vanishing point.

the pilot (Namiki) are quite consistent with the ink they prefer. the sterling and the falcon series behave the same way. when the right ink is out in them, they have a very generous ink flow and are very pleasant writers.

the vanishing point pen, has an excellent seal when retracted; even after being stored for a couple of weeks, the nip does not get dried out.";;
1749059567-96;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"Purchased the Pilot VP in red/gold with the fine nib, really writes well.  This pen is more burgundy than red, I was hoping for red as pictures sometimes don't display the true colors.  Most reviews of this pen are right... quick list of points below that I plan on adding more later:

* con-50 converter included does not hold much ink
* For some writers, clip is in the way... for me it works and like it as I can feel for the clip knowing the nib is facing up.
* Very audible click
* Reviews I've read states this pen is not ideal for a long writing session, I don't tend to have long writing sessions but writing a full page was fine.. did not notice anything unconformable about using the pen.";;
1749059567-97;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This fountain pen writes like a dream and is so nice in the hand.  Since it is retractible I don't worry about carrying this fountain pen in my bag or folio.

I was hesitant to buy this since some reviews said that it is was the cheaper version.  I have verified that in the US they are calling it the Capless.  My nib is 18k with rodium finish, so it is as advertised.

I am so glad that I splurged. This is a wonderful pen to write with, and am always finding reasons to use it.";;
1749059567-98;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"This pen is a workhorse.  Like any fountain pen, you should use it often.  I carry this everyday because of the click feature that makes this pen so accessible.  You just have to get used to rotating the pen when removed the pocket because it is oriented tip up in the pocket.  I got the medium nib which is super smooth. The 18k gold nib glides over the paper.  Its line is thinner that other medium nib pens that I have which I like.  It produces a nice line on notebook paper but I have noticed that copy paper absorbs the ink and so you get a thicker line.  I got the black and gold coloration and it looks good in the pocket.  I have only used the included blue cartridge so far because the ink I ordered has not arrived yet, but it is a nice color and very simple to install.  Basically, you get all the smoothness of a fountain pen with the convenience of a click pen.  Highly recommended!

I will probably buy another one with the red coloration and use it exclusively with red ink.  This pen is that good!";;
1749059567-99;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I like fountain pens but have hesitated purchasing the Pilot Vanishing Point.  For one, it has a small protruding nib when extended, similar to that found on the Lamy 2000, and doesn't provide the eye-hand orientation that keeps the nib properly rotated.  The second issue was its bulk as it is slightly bigger and fatter than pens I use - about the same length as a capped Lamy Safari.  Third, its a metal pen and I tend to like pens that are lighter.  An last, its that shirt clip - how can that be comfortable - I could see myself getting comfortable with the size, weight and small nib but that clip??  So I finally bought one because I enjoy the fine Pilot nibs and I am glad I did.  What a great pen.  The shirt clip doesn't bother me at all and as my fingers straddle it the pen and nib become properly oriented so no skipping.  And while it has some weight and size it is fairly light and comfortably held for long writing sessions.  So where else can you get a great writing nib, in a metal protective shroud, with the convenience of a retractable pen??;;
1749059567-100;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I'm totally in love with this pen. I'll leave the details to the many reviews already done, but had to add my 5 stars to the mix. Beautiful pen. Not as thick as the picture might suggest. Perfectly balanced for my writing style. Well-constructed, good solid feel, but not heavy. Writes like a charm. Just perfect. The click feature to extend and withdraw the nib is genius. Good solid feel. Fun to watch the litle door inside the pen open and close as the nib goes in and out. Keeps me from constantly re-capping when I am not actively writing and fear that the ink flow will dry up. Clips upside down, so you won't forget to retract the nib. Was easy enough to fill with ink using the included converter. the converter is the newer model with a little piece of something inside of it, which is supposed to promote better ink flow. I had bought and returned the LAMY 2000 because of skipping problems with the nib and what I think to be a cheap feel. The pilot vanishing point outscores the LAMY, imho, easily on these issues.;;
1749059567-101;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;Wonderful writing experience.  I purchased the fine nib and I love it.  I use the cartridges and haven't filled my pen with a pump.  I figure that I could afford the cartridges if I could afford the pen.  The retractable nib is the game changer for me. As a student, I loved fountain pens and tried to hang on even after the retractable tip ball writer (ball point pen) became the norm.  The retractable tip was just too convenient.  I ended up using a Lamy ball point/mechanical pencil for the last 20 years.  For a period of 4 or 5 years before that, I used a Rotring multicolor pen but went to the Lamy for convenience.  However the chance to use a retractable tip fountain pen could not be passed up after I read the article on pens in the WSJ a few months ago.  It doesn't leak and it is always ready to go..... can you believe it?  Now I'm really happy.  I carry a cheap Kuru Toga mechanical pencil in my briefcase when I need a pencil.;;
1749059567-102;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;This is my third Vanishing point pen. It is a phenomenal instrument and I truly enjoy writing with it. It looks good and flows smoothly on most paper using many different types of  Noodlers ink (most commonly Bernenke Blue). It is a five star pen with one exception and that is that I tend to be rough on pens.  Both times the pen was dropped on a steel deck which broke the metal cover at the tip.  Hopefully 3 times is a charm.  It takes a minute to get used to the clip at the bottom but it is what ensures me the pen is in the right position for writing.  I strongly recommend this pen for any user of fine writing instruments.;;
1749059567-103;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I bought blue vanishing point back in mid-90s and used it every day.  On July 1, 2010, my house was burgled and the pen was stolen.  I finally replaced it this week, and I am so glad I did.  This is a great pen: it writes well, it feels good in your hand, and it is classy in meetings.

The shipping was horrible though.  My first delivery was a medium matte black, which was then replaced with a fine red.  Amazon could not do another replacement, so I had to go through the hassle of a full return and purchase.  Eek.  So a 2 day delivery on prime took over 10 days and trips to Kohls and UPS.";;
1749059567-104;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"First a clarification: do not confuse this with the Pilot Capless Alloy Nib. The Vanishing Point is the same as the Capless, the names are just variants of US branding and older Japanese releases. The difference is in the nib material. Double check the nib, if you ordered a gold plated nib, it will have the engraving ""18k..."" Or ""14k..."" If you ordered the gold plated nib. It is not gold in color unless you ordered something similar. The gold is layered by other materials such as rhodium. If you ordered the alloy nib, then there is a cheaper version of this pen that sells for less than $100. Again, it's all in the nib.

Smoothest writer of all my pens and easiest to engage. I will be ordering another since I liked it that much.";;

1749059567-106;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;"I really appreciate the unique one-handed retractable click design of this Pilot VP pen for on-the-go note taking. This pen is well made with substantial weight and balance. The clip placement is easily adaptable and acts as a subtle guide for proper nib alignment w/o having to look. The SU (stub) 18k nib, however, writes like a nail on Rhodia 80g paper (less one star). There is a considerable amount of feedback that I wasn't expecting in a gold nib. I have since purchased an extra nib unit in FINE that I also find somewhat toothy. I may use a 12000 grit micro-mesh sheet to smooth out the nibs if they don't work themselves out with further use. All in all, a very convenient design and a definite keeper in my meager collection.

Note:  the newer CON-40 converter was included  :D";;
1749059567-107;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;Any time I meet a pen person, I have to show them my pen, and they are amazed and then they try it and seem to love the balance and feel, too. I don't like a giant pen, so this feels really good to me - it's not too heavy, and is very comfortable for hours of writing. And, nifty or not, the retractable feature is just SOOOOOO convenient. There's just something nifty about a retractible fountain pen.  After 6 months, I still love it. It does have a very small reservoir, but I'm ok with that, as I like to change ink colors a lot, anyway. I'm pretty good at tuning fountain pens, but really didn't need to do anything with this one. It writes like a hovercraft - just glides - very smooth - I hardly feel it against the paper, unless the paper is really rough. I can write as quickly or slowly as I want. I think I got extra fine, and am surprised at how fine a line it really will make, if I want. Amazon's price was great, too.;;
1749059567-108;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;I purchased the medium nib which writes beautifully smooth and wet, but it writes  broader than other pilot medium fountain pens. The quality of the fountain pen is excellent and it has a nice weight to it.;;

I have this with the extra fine nib and just love how it writes. Some reviews talk about the drag or scratchy nature of this nib but for me that’s the beauty of it. I love that feel as the nib moves over the paper as I write and I have not stopped writing since I received this vanishing point fountain pen. It has become my everyday carry. All I can say is I love this pen!;;

The 18k inscription confirms the true identity of the pen.
It was a wild ride looking up all this but this is a nice pen, comes with a refillable cartridge and a spare non-refillable cartridge along with a metal cap.
Worth the money, solid pen, definitely would recommend!";;
1749059567-111;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005WPTTG4;so, as for some background, i love fountainpens, and have a lamy 2000 and several others. i got this at a bargain price for work. so, the good is that i love the clip and it stays clipped to my polo shirts and is easy to take on and off. no cap to mess with. the nib is super smooth and a pleasure to write with. looks good. unlikely to roll off a desk. the click mechanism is stout and is a pleasure to use. also, very easy to find replacement nibs from various nibmeisters to replace this. i was considering getting a richard binder xxf waverly nib for it for doing document work. overall very user friendly. the bad: not a fan of pens >$50 needing cartridges and converters. but, not sure of how else this pen could have a different fill mechanism though. so, as for capacity, use a finer nib and the cartridges and it seems to last for 2-3 days of heavy use with a medium nib. likely longer with smaller points. overall glad i got it and it is now loaded with noodlers aircorps blue-black and functioning nicely.;;

The notoriously barnacle making Diamine Ancient Copper was too dry, but other inks have worked well, especially the wet Diamine scented Pick Me Up is great in it. I haven’t tried any shimmer inks and probably won’t.";;
1749060734-3;https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001AX3SR8;"A great pen.  It wrote exceptionally well with the included Pilot Black cartridge.  It's fine and dry enough that you can write on cheap paper (eg. Mead notebooks, checks, etc) without feathering or spreading like crazy.  The nib is pretty smooth (especially with a wet, lubricated ink), but not as smooth as a Vanishing Point with a gold <F> nib (which is also a little broader and much wetter).  I use my VP with a gold <F> nib at work where I use Black 'n Red notepads with decent paper, and carry this steel nibbed VP at home and running errands where paper quality will vary.

After I used up the included cartridge, I slapped in a CON-50 and I've been using bottled inks since.  You have to purchase a CON-40, CON-50 or CON-20 converter separately as this pen doesn't come with a converter (unlike the gold-nib VPs that come with a CON-40).";;

The retractable shave the higher end  nib which are smooth as butter. These nibs are steel with a gold coating and are as smooth as margarine.
They write well on most kinds of paper and are a little stiffer but not that much. Otherwise they are pretty much the same as the more expensive version.
Comes with lots of paper that is written in Chinese so was pretty much useless to me

I am replacing a 'lost' pilot pen with this one and it has not failed to impress.  I decided to switch from a medium to fine nib as it better suits my handwriting style.  The result is fine and precise lines, where as the medium nimb could get a bit mushy and result in crayon like lines.  If you find yourself flipping over your medium nib pen to get finer lines, then you may want to consider getting a fine point version.

The pen is a classic in terms of not much has changed from the model I purchased more than 10 years ago. I am still hoping to find it in an infrequently worn suit or pair of pants, fingers crossed.";;

I’m a huge Pilot fan and love their fine <F> nibs. This pen does not disappoint! It is a bit of a dry writer, which is not surprising with a small nib in fine. The notoriously barnacle making Diamine Ancient Copper was too dry, but other inks have worked well, especially the wet Diamine scented Pick Me Up is great in it.
