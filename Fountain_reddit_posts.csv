";"A great haul! You got a good mix of things. Very nice. Love, love the gingham washi and the travelers stickers! Love the Midori stickers and...I definitely have 'stencil' moments that only a stencil can address! My JetPens order is in process, but no stencils. Could you show the stickers better?? I have those stamps on my wish list What are your plans for the travelers spiral notebook? Thank you! I find myself a collector of sorts lol Thank you!! I‚Äôm so excited for the washi tape Which ones?! The stackable ones? They‚Äôre so cute! I will say they feel like they fall apart kind of easy so I‚Äôm worried about losing parts lol Ahh yes meant to mention that. I really like travel journaling/junk journaling, and i was watching a YouTube video about a travelers notebook setup and she used the window envelopes to collect ephemera! Easier to keep items separate by day. What were you most excited for? The one with the blue card That‚Äôs a great idea!! Happy journaling! Probably the Hobonichi covers!! And the washi! Hard to photograph since its night but look how cute!! It‚Äôs little party/birthday stickers!

State of the Collection;;"Which ones your favorite? It‚Äôs time for a pilot vanishing point decimo! State of the art ?ü©∑ Wow! Wanna enter the world of fountain pens, I adore beautiful designs and attention to detail, which would you recommend for a total beginner? Where did you find Yoda?? I love it edit spelling The Muji! It was my very first fountain pen, and my mother got it for me, so it holds a special place in my heart. Been looking to add some vintage pens to my fountain pen collection as well. It's such a different market, though. Sure! If you're just curious to see how they are but don't want to commit to anything yet, the Pilot Varsity is a great place to start. It's technically not refillable, but it's only $2-3 at Michael's, so you won't be losing much if you give it a try. 

For something a little more permanent, the Platinum Preppy is an excellent beginner pen. It's around $5-6, but you can refill the included cartridge with a syringe, and the pen already comes with two cartridges. You can also buy a separate converter, but I wouldn't recommend doing that yet. 

I actually have a Platinum Preppy (third one from the left on the bottom row), but mine is the Kokuyo Edition, which uses an all white design instead of clear plastic like the original. I think it looks classier that way. It's about $7-8, which is a pretty great price for a starter pen. The Star Wars fountain pens were a [gift](https://www.reddit.com/r/pens/s/aeSZk9n7bJ) from my aunt! Awesome! The platinum sounds great! I'll see how I like it! Than you!! Thank you for the link! No prob. And if you want more recommendations, feel free to reach out or reply in this thread.";386;https://i.redd.it/e6oemhthpxle1.jpeg;stationery;"State of the Collection  Which ones your favorite?

M.lovewell haul (and Home Goods);"Had a little shopping spree yesterday. Was excited to see they had some Travelers Notebook Tokyo items. Picked up a vanishing point too! I love it, but I do have a question. When I ink it, the plastic well only fills up to about 30%. VP owners, is that irregular? 

Also visited Home Goods and found the Leuchtturm. Not pictured are the handful of birthday cards I got too. Home goods card prices are way more affordable than Target. ";"Nice! I just discovered M.Lovewell more recently. Are there other M.Lovewell stores outside of OC? I haven't bought a pen from them and only see them in the display cases. I'm guessing they do also include the original boxes when you buy them? As for the VP converter, it's a bit finicky to get it to fill. I don't personally have one, but here's a video that might help you get more ink. [https://youtu.be/QSdKmShGHcA?si=c7g6MdvF3YSwcJFE&t=132](https://youtu.be/QSdKmShGHcA?si=c7g6MdvF3YSwcJFE&t=132) If you want a bit more capacity, you can use an empty cartridge and fill it up with ink using a hobby syringe. Best of luck! Great haul. I better go to Home Goods to find those notebooks & stationery. >When I ink it, the plastic well only fills up to about 30%. VP owners, is that irregular?

Sadly this is all too regular, the CON-40 is a terrible converter to begin with and it has especially bad compatibility with the VP nib unit, the result being you can barely get it half-full at the best of times.  Your options are:

1. Use a blunt-tipped syringe(ex. https://www.jetpens.com/JetPens-Ink-Syringe/pd/22182) to refill either the converter itself or an empty cartridge.
2. Replace with a CON-B: [https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-CON-B-Fountain-Pen-Converter/pd/26303](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-CON-B-Fountain-Pen-Converter/pd/26303), this is technically a ""lower tier"" converter than the CON-40 used for Pilot's budget level pens but it works much better IMO. So jealous you managed to find the TN Tokyo charms, they are sold out everywhere! This was very helpful. Thank you so much! Yes, I went to the Santa Ana location. The ones on display seem to be only for show as the pen I got was pulled from their stock room. All original box and papers included (new).

Does an erasable pen exist that isn't affected by heat or cold?;"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm just exploring an idea and would love some feedback.

So, you know those Pilot FriXion pens? They erase with friction, but the ink disappears in heat and comes back in cold.  

I‚Äôve read some reviews where people accidentally left notes in the sun and the ink vanished.

What if there was a similar erasable pen/marker that:

\- can be erased with a rubber eraser (like FriXion),

\- but isn't affected by heat or cold?

Does something like that already exist?  

Would that actually be useful to anyone? Or is the existing solution good enough?

Totally fine if the idea is already out there ‚Äî just wanted to hear thoughts from people who‚Äôve used these kinds of pens. Thanks a lot!

";"Pencil ? If it‚Äôs not removed with friction/heat alone then it would have to be like sanding the paper to come extent. In France they use erasable ink cartridges with fountain pens. That ink last DECADES (I have 30 years old homework where I used that ink!) unless you have the matching erasable pen. Really efficient and cheap.¬†https://www.faber-castell.co.uk/products/InkeraserroundtipBsetof2/185569 Papermate erasermate. Writes like any other ballpoint, erases clean, but if you write with a lot of pressure the indents will be an issue I would tend to agree here. What are you looking for in this erasable pen that‚Äôs not provided by a pencil? The bold color maybe? The first frixion pens I had did remove the paper with the ink. I have not gone back to see if they are any better.

Uni-ball erasable 0.7 pens are actually better than I thought they would be, but it took a bit of writing before the ink started to come through properly. For a day or so it was like the centre of the line was light with an edge that was dark. I didn't stop using it because it cost money and fortunately found out it got better. Yeah the quality of that ink or consistency rather is why I've never gotten into them for the most part, they would be really nice for notepads and not needing to repurchase them but I just couldn't stand the way they wrote";7;https://www.reddit.com/r/stationery/comments/1jv5huq/does_an_erasable_pen_exist_that_isnt_affected_by/;stationery;"Does an erasable pen exist that isn't affected by heat or cold?

Yeah the quality of that ink or consistency rather is why I've never gotten into them for the most part, they would be really nice for notepads and not needing to repurchase them but I just couldn't stand the way they wrote";;

Good pens/pencils for annotating books;"Hey all,

It's basically just as the title says lol; When I read I like to annotate in the book itself, both as a way to jot down my thoughts quickly and find them & what part they relate to easier when I go back to the book. Currently I'm using a pilot Frixion pen and it's working well but it's not perfect either. 

My ideal pen/pencil would be something refillable, preferably has a finer nib (like 0.5mm or so) and is a ballpoint/rollerball. Bonus points if it's got a good grip, I tend to grip pens overly hard so some cushioning would be nice lol. 

Thank you guys in advance :) ";"What don't you like about the Frixion? That could help narrow down a better pen I like my pilot s3 drafting pencil in .3. The lead I‚Äôm currently using is Pentel‚Äôs ain stein in 2B. Its looks like a regular mechanical pencil, no frills but also no cushiony grip. It has some ridges on the grip section but otherwise its a bare sleek pencil. I chose it because of the cute color options & it was affordable. 

Its fine so you may like it for writing in the margins or between text. The lead is dark and in combination with whatever the pencil has going on for it (maybe the weight distribution?its still lightweight) it feels good to write with. I sometimes write in mass market paperbacks and i haven‚Äôt pierced the paper or made indentations (though i do use a lighter hand). 

While the line is crisp and dark, I don‚Äôt have issues with lead breakage in this particular lead unless im writing long form & extend the lead too much, but thats more of a ‚Äòme‚Äô problem. Especially because i press hard when my hand starts getting tired & when i lose patience for consistent neat handwriting. Try the Frixion Knock Zone Pen with Frixion refills in 0.3mm or 0.4mm

Recommendations for non-bleed pens?;"I use Tombow watercolour markers for almost everything, but man do they make my regular black writing pen bleed and smudge! 

I‚Äôm currently using a Pilot Poplol because I like the nib feel, but the ink flows so horribly and smudges very easily! 

Bonus points if it comes in multiple colours too! ";"I use the pentel energel (cinnamoroll) pen and just wait a little bit before going over it with my tombows and it doesn‚Äôt smudge. 

It will smudge if you go over it immediately or if you press down really heavily over the pen line. 

I‚Äôm writing on Midori paper if that helps. Bleed and feathering is mostly a matter of paper, not ink: Try Uni-Ball Signo 207. The gel ink is made of pigment and is waterproof when dry, and it dries pretty quickly, at least to the point that it won't smudge with a dry finger after just a few seconds. I've seen endorsements by legal people saying it's the best pen for signing checks because it's so waterproof and permanent. It comes in multiple gel colors too, tho I'm unsure if they share the same permanency It helps to learn the difference between water based inks, pigment inks, and so on, and you will understand why this is happening, moreso than taking some particular suggestions,  once you learn you'll be able to pick from anything what will work!

Fine fountain pen;"I'm sort of new to fountain pens. I love that they write sooo smooth and want to practice my penmanship with them more. I recently got just some pilot precise varsity 1mm medium point pens (~$25usd/6pk) which are a great cheap way for me to just learn how it feels when it writes.

I want finer lines but I'm worried if I go with a finer nib it might be scratchy* when I write which honestly is a sensory issue for me when pens are too scratchy. Does anyone have any  suggestions for a budget friendly fine tip fountain pen that is smooth when it writes?

I'll take any suggestions though I'm not looking to spend more than around $50 on a fountain pen right at the moment.";"Pilot kakuno is a great option, with some diff nib options. Should give you a daily pen you dont have to care too much about and help you get a feel for what you like and don't. 

Lamy safari and twsbi eco are nice too, a bit more expensive, built better Japanese nibs tend to run finer than western nibs. I know that someone easier has mentioned Pilot - which is a fantastic pen (and has a smiley face on the nib!)

I wanted to add a recommendation for the Platnium Preppy! It's super cheap <$5! And honestly is fantastic pen!

You've mentioned not like scratchy pens - with fountain pens the paper is also important and so you should be aware that paper can also play a part in this - something like a a super cheap copy paper cam add to the drag and scratchy-Ness feel of a pen. Good fountain pen papers eg Rhodia or Clairefontaine will add to the smoothness I would recommend an Asvine P36 with an Asvine EF steel nib. You can find them on Amazon for $49 last I checked. 

I only own the P36 but any Asvine with an Asvine nib will probably write the same. On Amazon most Asvine pens are offered with either a Bock or Asvine nib. I recommend avoiding the Bock nibs - they are not bad nibs but not as good as the Asvine.

Looking for the most resistant permanent marker for a shiny surface;"I use some laminated sheets of paper to which I intend to write with fine lines and expect it to be resitant to smudges once they dry up.

I currently use **Stabilo OH Pen Universal Permanent** and **Faber-Castell Multimark 1525 Permanent**, and I'm very disappointed with the Stabilo while the Faber Castell is a bit better but still less resistant to smudges that what I need.

&#x200B;

I'm on the lookout for the best available fine line permanent marker brand and model that would resist smudging once the shiny surface dries up. Bonus points if the top choice doesn't dry too slow.

&#x200B;

**Later edit, of the ones available in my region in Europe, I bought way more permanent markers than I should and I tested their resistance to smudges over time, here are the results:**

&#x200B;

PASSED

* Faber-Castell Multimark 1525 - Size M
* EDDING 400 - 1MM
* EDDING 3000

&#x200B;

Almost FAILED

* BIC Intensity Permanent - Ultra Fine

&#x200B;

FAILED:

* Uni Oil Based Super Ink Marker - Fine
* Stabilo OH Pen Universal Permanent

&#x200B;";"Pilot makes oil-based fine liners that are designed to work on shiny surfaces. They are available on [Tokyo Pen Shop.](https://tokyopenshop.com/products/pilot-drawing-pen-oil-type) I am using alcohol based Staedtler Lumocolor Permanent for decades. I think its verry good for most usecases. For plastik and metal. They  come in different tip sizes.

(technically this is not stationary anymore, this is industrial) Thanks, my usecase is I write on laminated templates, and then when I'm done I clean and reuse the templates.

I have re-edited my initial post with the new findings. Isn't that the oposite of ""resistant"" and ""permanent""?

A pen that is easy to whipe of with felt, but is resistant to touch is the staedtler lumocolor correctable.

I have a laminated rfid card that I labeled with this pen, which I handle once every day for 11 months now and the writing is just a little scratched. I meant to say I clean it when I mean to.

I currently use **Stabilo OH Pen Universal Permanent** and **Faber-Castell Multimark 1525 Permanent**, and I'm very disappointed with the Stabilo while the Faber Castell is a bit better but still less resistant to smudges that what I need.

&#x200B;

I'm on the lookout for the best available fine line permanent marker brand and model that would resist smudging once the shiny surface dries up. Bonus points if the top choice doesn't dry too slow.

&#x200B;

**Later edit, of the ones available in my region in Europe, I bought way more permanent markers than I should and I tested their resistance to smudges over time, here are the results:**

&#x200B;

PASSED

* Faber-Castell Multimark 1525 - Size M
* EDDING 400 - 1MM
* EDDING 3000

&#x200B;

Almost FAILED

* BIC Intensity Permanent - Ultra Fine

&#x200B;

FAILED:

* Uni Oil Based Super Ink Marker - Fine
* Stabilo OH Pen Universal Permanent

&#x200B; Pilot makes oil-based fine liners that are designed to work on shiny surfaces. They are available on [Tokyo Pen Shop.](https://tokyopenshop.com/products/pilot-drawing-pen-oil-type) I am using alcohol based Staedtler Lumocolor Permanent for decades.

Oops!...I did it again. Stationery Pal haul;;"Ordered 12/10, shipped 13/10 and received two weeks later on 27/10.

The TomBow Mono graph mechanical pencils were out of stock on my last order, so when they came back in stock you know I ended up with a second order. 

Big clear thing is a washi tape dispenser, have not used it yet. It's the stackable kind though, perfect if you have a large collection and need multiple dispensers.

Tried the Pilot Juice pens for the first time during my last order and really enjoyed them so I picked up some more colours. 

The notecard says to use the code ""MeAgain"" for 10% your order, not sure if it works for new orders though. II have tried the juice pens out before and used the whole thing, really nice! I've got a complete set of the Pilot Juice pens in 0.38 point-I love them! [deleted] I got two of those washi dispensers recently for my more frequently used grid tapes! So far I‚Äôm happy with them, especially when I found out you can flip the blade for two different cuts My normal go to is the Pentel EnerGels, I've gone through so many refills. Excited to see how the Juice pens go long term! 

Is it just me or is Juice just the perfect name for them? The black is so inky which I love in pens. I didn't know they made them that thin! They don't offer free shipping, in their FAQ they mention that when places offer free shipping you're still paying for it because it's built into the price. 

Not sure how true that is really. But I found the shipping to Ireland was reasonable. I did two orders, both times the shipping was under ‚Ç¨9 (~‚Ç¨7.50 and ‚Ç¨8.50). 

When you're adding stuff to your basket it lets you check how much the shipping will be. When I divided the shipping out amongst the products I got it didn't add too much to each items cost, but that may vary based on where you live. 

Hope that helps! I noticed that there was serration on the other side but didn't take a proper look at it, thank you so much for letting me know why!

Need help determining where to put vanishing points?;"This has always been my biggest issue and I can't seem to find any explanation for this. This is more about 2-point perspective. (those two points on left & right, ARGH!)

Most tutorials would just say to just put it somewhere, preferably off the page, then make your lines follow it... But I can't determine where to put them! Am I supposed to put it just wherever I like?

Like how would vanishing points relate to how we see stuffs, our vision, the angle we're looking, etc. -Like on horizon line, it would relate to how we tilt the view/camera.

Some explanation say the vanishing points would relate to the subject. But I don't understand how that would relate to how we really see. Some say it relates to how far/close we are but again, that would mean it is determined by a subject.

Like how would you be looking, if one of the vanishing points is closer/is in the page, or how is your view if the vanishing points are way off the page?

I mainly draw from imagination so I have to make my own vanishing points & it's frustrating me!";"in 2-point perspective and above, if your points are all on the page, that'd likely result in a REALLY extreme-looking perspective. imagine fisheye without any curves, basically. 

the vanishing points themselves are invisible guidelines, and aren't really meant to relate to how we see things in real life. the lines that come from them and the angles they create, however, do. where the lines intersect is the point closest to the camera, and the vanishing points themselves are generally the farthest from the camera.

you need to place them in a way that creates the perspective you want--so if you want something realistic, place them far apart, if you want something more extreme, place them closer together. you'll get a feel for when something looks too extreme or too flat naturally.

basically it takes a lot of practice and observation and trial-and-error to learn how to place them where you want to, and you absolutely shouldn't be STARTING a picture with vanishing points before you get the hang of how to see things in perspective using them. do a rough sketch and then use them to correct your perspective.  Vanishing points on the page are going to cause the perspective to be more dynamic. Off the page the perspective lines will be less angular. Having dynamic perspective will make objects appear to be closer to the viewer, and may cause the image to have more drama. There are always exceptions of course. You can easily experiment by drawing random squares on a page(or several pages) and picking different vanishing points, then using those points to turn the squares into cubes. In the end it's one of those things you've got to figure out for yourself. Your perspective should serve the image or story you're trying to tell.

Question about perspective in regards to figure drawing;"Might be a stupid question but I've read several books and none seem to cover it. Maybe I'm just missing it ? 

When we relate a figure to the horizon line, I see it always done from head to toes across the length of the figure, but never the width.

What i mean is when you draw a box in 2 point you're relating both sides to that two point. When I see people do figure drawing they do it as if the side is flush to the background and without perspective.

I've read Loomis, Hampton and several others and I'm finding this very confusing. I always see one set of lines relating that figure to the horizon instead of two which makes me think every figure is drawn in one point ?

I can't recall a single book actually mention what parts should be relating to that horizon.

Sorry If this is a stupid question, I've spent a lot of time looking for the answer and feel like it's time to try and ask others.

On a side note, can anyone recommend any book that specifically goes into figure drawing perspective. I know it's all the same and books like scott robertsons ; how to draw. should cover it all. I have a very weird way of thinking it seems.";"Andrew Looms, Figure drawing for all it's worth, chapter 1 (starting around page 42) has some guidelines on this. Basically boils down to drawing both side and front (and perhaps top) projections of the figure in the 2 (3) flat planes in perspective, and then combining both into one 3D figure. I see those illustration and I still don't understand why he's relating the front of the figure to the horizon as if in 1p and not the side of the figure even in a 3 quarter pose. If i was to take a box and place it in that pose, it'd be in 2 p with both sides converging to a separate VP. so why is this different in figure drawing and is it always different ?

I'm sorry if I'm missing the point here I just really need to understand this. I've been told that perspective is the same for organic and industrial but in that example of the figure vs a box it's different ? It is the same. The front of the figure at page 42 is not flush with the back plane, but it's close to it, perhaps that causes your confusion. You'll notice those lines are not horizontal, the vanishing point is just very far to the left. On page 31 there's a more pronounced angle/perspective for the front view. You just make 3 of those views (front/side/top view) for each figure, and construct the 3D shape this way. Not the front of the figure, but the side. That's what's confusing me, it's clear he's having the front of his figures relate to the perspective and you can see it as you mentioned on page 31 with his lines from the front of the figure casting towards the VP. The side is what i find confusing, I never see people relating the side of the figure to the horizon, even in a 3 quarter view which if you consider was a box you'd see equal convergence from front and side.

I understand the front and how I should be relating it to the horizon but the side, the depth, is what I find confusing. I never see lines showing anyone relate it to the horizon like it's shown for the front, which is what initially confused me into thinking every figure is drawn in 1p. I think it's more a matter of economy. In theory you're right, it's just the same thing for the front and side, and you can construct both. But the side view is relatively shallow, meaning that the back of the side view is not significantly smaller than the front. So you can get away with constructing just the front, and then winging (guesstimating) the side part of it. If you're above or below the figure a lot, that does the affect the angle of feet (like on page 49), but other than that I don't think it pays off meticulously constructing the side view before doing the 3D view. I'd stick with the 3D boxes like on page 49, and perhaps doing a front view in that.

I wouldn't bother with doing a perspective side view, but you can definitely do it, there's nothing against it. You should probably just do it for a while and see for yourself whether or not it pays off in terms of a more accurate 3D view. Thank you so much, so because the side view is much shallower, perspective plays a smaller roll so I can and most seem to draw it as if without perspective. as long as my larger form obeys the perspective it shouldn't make things seem incorrect ? and I'm guessing the larger the side view the more I need to obey perspective. like if the front and side view of an object are of equally large size they should both show perspective like a car for example ? Yes, I think that's the unspoken consideration. But if a person is for example running, the side view will suddenly become not so shallow, and perspective will play a bigger role, and then it pays off constructing the side view as well. So it's a matter of choosing how much of construction you need to get to a sufficiently accurate result. Thank you so much for this, you're a saint. I know now that reading the previous comments and my issue. it seems so obvious that something with less volume on one side to the other would have less of a convergence than the larger side. Which also explains why I'm so confused comparing it to a cube that has equal sides lool. I know it seems obvious but I wish even if in a side note this was mentioned by any of the authors in the books I've read. It seems so obvious now you've explained it but having compared everything to a cube in the start is what threw me off. Thank you again, so so much T_T<3 You're welcome! Sometimes you're stuck in a way of thinking, and then an external view can help you break out of that. sorry one more question if you don't mind. Considering the figure has three major movable masses (excluding limbs) (page 52 loomis, figure sitting) as an example. How are you relating those parts to the horizon as he mentioned previously in the book there is only the one horizon for the scene but with these three masses I don't get how you can align each mass to the same horizon with so many different possible positions. say i have that sitting figures head raised facing forward, while the torso and waist face an opposite direction or am I confusing myself some how ";2;https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/7g5hmw/question_about_perspective_in_regards_to_figure/;Art;"Question about perspective in regards to figure drawing Might be a stupid question but I've read several books and none seem to cover it.

I just looked him up and apparently he also co-produced the weeknd's new album.

Anyhow I was drawing on the subway once, and he came up and gave me a CD saying ""your drawings are great, I like to find new artists"" - I said ""thanks"", gave him my drawing book - and wrote him off as eccentric but nice. I mean, people talked to me all the time on the subway when I was drawing, so I didn't think much of it.

Then I heard his CD and it blew my mind.
A few years later he was a judge on Canada's got talent. And is now producing the Weeknd!?!

my drawings: http://www.mattwhelan.com/Flash/Drawings/ Great work! Looked at your some of your other artwork as well. Really like your work. I still can't get over how perfect this rendition is :D Mad love to /u/WordFederation for the awesome original photo that I painted from. 

http://i.imgur.com/UpKs2nt.jpg

Check him out at Apperley Digital on Facebook and Instagram!  Wow this is beautiful! From the thumbnail I thought it was a photo. 

There's one thing I want to point out, though. Your use of perspective is very well done, the lines of the road/track and the buildings all point to roughly the same vanishing point, except for one. The sidewalk on the very left is too paralell to the line on the other side of the car. It makes it look like the car is on a decline, and at a different angle than the cars on the other side of the train. 

I'm sure you already know this, because it would be hard to be this good and not know it, but an easy way to do perspective is  to choose a single point in the center of the paper, in the middle of the horizon. Then with any lines coming to you or moving away from you, you draw them with a ruler that crosses that point so that they line up.

But none the less, amazing. I can't paint for shit, just draw, so this is miles ahead of me. Toronto represent! Love how the perspective has come out! Any tips on how to learn perspective drawing? I've tried a few times but haven't gotten very far.  Technical drawing has helped :) Sweet story! Toronto is full of talent, for sure. Your work is great! I love life drawing, it really challenges your preconceptions of shapes and shadows. Keep it up!! Thanks! I'm curious where you've seen my other artwork? I don't recall posting to Reddit... <3 <3 <3 Hey! Thank you so much for pointing that out!  I used a vanishing point but clearly dropped the ball on the sidewalk when I was re-touching the car. I can't un-see it now so I'm going to go back and correct it. 

Good looking out, I really appreciate it.  You know it!  Thanks! I just painted this from a photo so I didn't think too much about perspective, other than using a vanishing point to make sure my lines made sense. As you're working on it, it'll feel awkward since your brain wants to make it isometric but just trust your vanishing point.  I'd love to see it after you fixed it!  http://imgur.com/BMoJGT4

"Untitled, Pencil + Paper, 8.5"" x 11""";;"I felt poor looking at this. Your perspective is coming along nicely, but there are a few problems. This is actually a trickier problem than it first appears. Your horizontals should converge to two vanishing points on the horizon. You seem to understand that concept, but you should double check a few of your lines, most notably the edge of the grass where it meets the driveway. That line should converge to the same point on the horizon as the lines that define the top and bottom of the fence as well as any other parallel lines. It looks like you tried to align it parallel to the car, but that is not correct.

The trickiest bit is the car. Because it's being raised in the back, all of its horizontal planes are now inclined planes. The lines along the incline of the plane should converge to a point directly above the vanishing point used for objects level with the ground plane (meaning above the horizon). Your lines are going in the right general direction, but they do not converge, leaving you with a distorted isometric projection that conflicts with other parts of the scene. The tires are level with the ground, so they should use the vanishing point on the horizon.

Hopefully my wording isn't too confusing and I hope it helps. It's hard to describe geometry without images. If you don't get what I mean I can try to clarify with pictures. ""Friday""

What is college drawing class suppose to be like?;"So I just started school and I'm taking the first drawing class. I plan to minor in art and I like to think I'm pretty good at it. This isn't an art student only class, this is, usually, a first year elective. I imagine most of the students taking it are not art students and just have a hobby in art. Which is the problem...

It's very hard. I'm not struggling at all but I've heard a few others saying they might have to drop the class because they are extremely overwhelmed. Our second homework assignment was to draw a CAR in one point in two point perspective. Keep in mind he never actually taught what one point and two point perspectives \*are\*. Nothing about horizon lines, no vanishing points, nothing about how they converge. I thought I'd spend this class bored out of my mind because I'd spent the first month or two reviewing terms and drawing a million boxes and spheres and cones. I went to talk to the art director and he told me the teacher was new and came from an actually art school so he was used to students who had a bit more of a base line. I doubt many of the kids in my class have taken an art class in their life!

I'm not going crazy right? This isn't what a basic art class in college suppose to be like? I feel like most of the students didn't just jump into the deep end, they were pushed in then had their heads held underwater.  


Also, he told one student he couldn't listen to music while drawing... which is something I was allowed to do in high school. It's not like he's lecturing. :/";"But also yeah, you will not be hand held and walked through how to do specific things. My experince was they give you the assignment and you just draw all day. Point is to use the class time to work hard on it. And when you are at home, you spend time in front of your cavas pretty seriously too. I'm in California and we just had to turn stuff in- just draw as you draw. Honestly, perspective was something I learned in highschool art class. If you think that's too hard, could you explain more of what you'd expect the class to be like? What were you expecting to draw? Have you looked him up on Rate My Professor.com? It's an amazing website to find out what other students have to say about the professor. There might be ratings on other classes he teaches but it gives you a feel for what his style is and if you note the class name on the left hand side as you read the review, some will be from the exact class you are taking now and will tell you about how it went for them when they took the class with him. It's normal. There is no problem here. Uhh... He gave an assignment he didn't teach the criteria for. That's not normal. And drawing a car in one or two point perspective is endgame dynamic sketching. Peter Han teaches it at art center. At the end of his course. This is a basic drawing class for students who are not an art major.

Did you actually read my post? Sure, but like I said, this is a basic drawing class for students who are not art majors. This is a basic elective and many of them have never taken an art class. I expected the teacher to at least explain basic terminology and demonstrate how to use vanishing points on a horizon line to accomplish one and two point perspective. None of this was covered.

Do you really think that drawing cars in one and two point perspective for the second homework is appropriate for the first art class that is not an art school? He just started working at my school, the art director told me he came from an actual art school.

I looked him up but I didn't find any results. Yup, same thing, intro elective class not exclusively for art students. Assignment: time to work on it: turn it in. No one will walk you through how to draw. They just let you fly. Also I'm sure you know you have to spend 3 hours a day per class outside of class on the subject. It sounds like maybe you should find a different teacher if you can, you gotta enjoy the class You honestly think that drawing a car in one and two point perspective is an appropriate assignment for the second day? 

Also, I suppose I should clarify, I'm having no problems. I'm concerned because a lot of classmates have talked about dropping the class due to being overwhelmed. I'm really not okay with this. I'm not concerned about myself. I'm a good artist. And frankly I am enjoying the class, seriously, did you not read my entire post? I thought I was going to be bored. This is not too difficult for me. I'm concerned about the other students who will think that art is overwhelming and unachievable because they have a dogshit instructor.";6;https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/cxbzzx/what_is_college_drawing_class_suppose_to_be_like/;Art;"What is college drawing class suppose to be like?

It's normal. There is no problem here. Uhh... He gave an assignment he didn't teach the criteria for. That's not normal. And drawing a car in one or two point perspective is endgame dynamic sketching. Peter Han teaches it at art center. At the end of his course. This is a basic drawing class for students who are not an art major.

Did you actually read my post? Sure, but like I said, this is a basic drawing class for students who are not art majors. This is a basic elective and many of them have never taken an art class. I expected the teacher to at least explain basic terminology and demonstrate how to use vanishing points on a horizon line to accomplish one and two point perspective. None of this was covered.

Do you really think that drawing cars in one and two point perspective for the second homework is appropriate for the first art class that is not an art school? He just started working at my school, the art director told me he came from an actual art school.

I looked him up but I didn't find any results. Yup, same thing, intro elective class not exclusively for art students. Assignment: time to work on it: turn it in. No one will walk you through how to draw. They just let you fly. Also I'm sure you know you have to spend 3 hours a day per class outside of class on the subject. It sounds like maybe you should find a different teacher if you can, you gotta enjoy the class You honestly think that drawing a car in one and two point perspective is an appropriate assignment for the second day? 

Also, I suppose I should clarify, I'm having no problems. I'm concerned because a lot of classmates have talked about dropping the class due to being overwhelmed. I'm really not okay with this. I'm not concerned about myself. I'm a good artist. And frankly I am enjoying the class, seriously, did you not read my entire post? I thought I was going to be bored. This is not too difficult for me. I'm concerned about the other students who will think that art is overwhelming and unachievable because they have a dogshit instructor.";;

Confused about perspective and reality!;"Hello Art people!

I've recently started drawing and am finding myself confused about perspective.

It seems to me that in every day life, wherever I look is the vanishing point, meaning wherever I literally face my head will become the vanishing point.

Is this accurate? There is often drawings of cities where the vanishing points are placed at the end of streets, whether it's one or two vanishing points. This is confusing to me because it seems we are using the shape of the buildings to determine our vanishing point, not the actual perspective of the observer.

Images used to teach perspective usually consist of cubes or buildings conveniently facing the same direction, but what if there was an image of a mess of cardboard boxes all facing different directions, let's say around 30, just spilled all over the place. In real life, would the vanishing point simply be the direction I'm facing?

And if so, in real life, without conveniently faced buildings, can there ever really be two vanishing points? Or is two or three vanishing points really more of a tool for certain contexts?

I guess I'm curious how vanishing points relate to reality. It's confusing to me how people can just just pick where there vanishing points will be in a drawing, we don't just pick our vanishing point willy nilly in day to day life, in a way it's picked for us by our perception. I can understand if it's not meant to represent reality, it's meant as a tool to aid your imagination, but then the question still remains, where is the vanishing point in reality?";"I think you're right about the vanishing point being where you are facing in reality. It's confusing because while the whole drawing may be in focus, it's not that way when you are looking at something. Any stretch of land, or road, or whatever you see in real life will vanish eventually if it goes on long enough. The difference is in reality, you can only choose one point to focus on enough to notice this. 

Same thing with your question about two point perspective. It would look like that if you had a wider field of vision, but in reality you can only focus on one of those points at a time. Think of a two point perspective drawing as like a panorama shot from a camera. 

Also, when I say it ""would"" look like that, I don't mean literally. It would basically look the same, but real life almost never looks exactly like a perspective drawing. 

I could also be wrong about everything I said  I struggled with this as well. The examples typically used to teach perspective can be confusing or misleading because they usually depict a single object or parallel objects, which all conform to the same vanishing points. In real life, or a scene with many boxes all facing different directions, you'll have many different sets of vanishing points. All of the objects share 2 things - a lens they are viewed though (think of a camera - ""How to draw"" by Scott Robertson explains this more thoroughly. It's a great resource on perspective) and a horizon line. Imagine a box with 2 vanishing points - if you were to draw a line from where you as the viewer are standing, to each of the vanishing points, the angle between these 2 lines would be 90 degrees. which makes sense, because it's a perfect cube, right? The same rule applies to any other perfect cube in your scene - they will maintain the same degree between their vanishing points, regardless of which way it is rotated (this is not true in one point perspective, though). The only time you'll use the same vanishing points for more than one object is when the objects have parallel edges. In real life you'll see a mix of different perspectives within the same scene - some objects are in one point, others in two. 

Basically - you need to think of perspective on an object to object basis, rather than using the same vanishing points for every object in a scene (though there are exceptions of course)  That's insightful and worded well! I was having trouble articulating exactly what you described about how the whole drawing is in focus which is not like real life. Thanks for the help! This helps a lot! Especially the end, much simpler to think of it in terms of an object to object basis. Also I realized today that the ground is a constant plane heading toward the natural earth horizon. Meaning if I were in space wherever I look would be more accurate for a vanishing point, however with the ground being there vanishing points tend to make sense parallel to the ground, unless you are on a tall building looking down.

Also, if you could, could you elaborate on what you mean by the lens objects are viewed through? Does that just mean the overall everything in a drawing, lighting, style, etc?
 Sure, by lens I mean the creative decision of how much distortion to add to the perspective of a piece. It's the same as photographers using different lenses to achieve a different feel for their subject matter. By using a certain lens you can make something feel larger or smaller than it actually is. It's tough to find a good example but if you pay close attention to the divisions of the [sidewalk here](http://www.bokehblog.com/public/Charts/lens-compression-chart-12mm-600mm-4k.jpg) you can tell that as the lens increases in size, the length of the sidewalk segments get smaller. In the 12mm shot, the far edge of the segment she is standing on is above her knees and as the lens size increases it moves closer and closer to the edge in front of her toes. All the while, she remains the same size - as the lens size increases, the viewer(photographer) must move away from her to keep her the same size within the frame and this is distance is what causes the distortion of the sidewalk segments. 

A good way to get a better grasp of this is to find photos taken with a certain lens and trace over them to find their vanishing points and horizon - making a perspective grid. You can also use those grids to draw on top of for your own work and the tough perspective stuff will already be taken care of for you. 

50mm is the lens closest to the human eye so things shot with a 50mm will feel most natural and have the least distortion. To achieve a 50mm feel, you can use what is called a [60¬∞ cone of vision](https://courses.byui.edu/art110_new/art110/week02/cone_of_vision.html). 

As far as the vanishing point changing wherever you look - that's true for one point perspective. I guess I don't quite understand your question, but [check this out](https://courses.byui.edu/art110_new/art110/week01/eye_level.html). Also, I can't recommend Scott Roberston's ""How to Draw"" enough, there is a chapter in the beginning on perspective terminology that has some really good illustrations and will answer a lot of your questions. The book itself is kinda tough to work through but it's worth it for the perspective knowledge alone.  Wow, thanks for the well thought out reply! This helps a lot.

I want to start drawing with ink, more specifically, the style of hatching. What supplies do I need?;I've been really interested in ink artwork, especially hatching. I've been using a normal pilot ink roller ball pen, which can't vary the size of the lines I'm drawing, which is obviously a big setback. I don't even know what to look for. Are fountain pens the best option (and can anyone learn to use them?) Would it be just as fine to use rollerball pens with different sized points? I'm really confused about what I should use, and I would really appreciate any guidance. I would appreciate it even more if you talk about specific products, because I don't have any knowledge about which pens are better than others.;"Hey, pen & ink artist here.  I might be able to help.

My current tools include a range of metal nibs, bamboo brush, and India ink.  Pretty traditional setup.  If you wanted to try this, you can find inexpensive drawing sets with a range of nibs, and you can get a small bottle of ink.  A smooth bristol board is preferable to the thinner, more absorbent drawing papers used for dry media.  Illustration board is more expensive, but it's my preference, personally.  Especially hot press, which is very smooth.

I'm not entirely sure if this is actually what you mean by ""fountain pens.""  A fountain pen actually refers to a pen with a similar kind of nib, with a reservoir for ink inside the holder.  It's basically the older, more expensive version of a roller ball, and the main advantage would be that the line has more character.  The reason I'd advice against these is that they're not as fine and not as good for hatching/crosshatching.  They're really made for writing.

I use roller balls for sketching, and I think if you wanted to just get familiar with pen & ink, these are a good starting point.  They're cheap, have flow similar to a fountain pen or traditional nib, and are portable.  Major disadvantage is that the ink is not waterproof and probably not archival (edit: well, the Pilot Visions aren't; I have found a rolling ball w/archival ink before, but the tip wasn't fine enough for me and I can't recall the brand).

Another option would be a marker or technical pen.  I've used the Micron Sakuras extensively, and they have the same advantage as the rolling ball in that they're cheap and portable (i.e. don't drip).  The ink in most brands is also waterproof and archival.  The disadvantage is they're closer to a felt tip in terms of flow, and usually don't give you the line character that even a rolling ball or fountain pen provides.  There are pens with brush tips, but I have very little experience with these.  Obviously not what you're looking for if a cross-hatched look is what you're going for.

If you have any further questions, just let me know. Thank you so much! This is very helpful.

I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot, but I have some more questions:

1) Are there any specific products of the items you mention that you prefer or are known to be high quality?

2) I don't understand what I place the metal nibs on.

3) Why do I have to use a bamboo brush? What paint should I use?

4) [What can I do to draw like this guy?](http://bagbosse.tumblr.com/post/86714770120/human-i-am-immaculate-you-are-a-bag-of-meat-if) 1) Speedball is the brand that's probably going to be easiest to find at most art stores.  I use their nibs and holders, mainly because I haven't been able to locate much else locally.  They make ink too, but I mainly use Higgins India ink.  I've been holding on to the same giant bottle for over a year now and planning to scope out a higher quality brand, as I'm dissatisfied with the black coverage.

I buy Utrecht store brand bristol board, but I've used Strathmore as well.  The difference is not that significant, though the latter would be regarded as your higher quality artist's brand.  Smooth is preferable to vellum finish.  As far as illustration board, I like Crescent hot press.

2) A pen holder sized for the type of nib you're using.  This is the one I use for crow quill nibs, which is mainly what I use: http://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-fine-point-dip-pen-nibs-and-holder/

3)  You don't have to use a bamboo brush or a brush at all.  I only use one for covering large areas of flat black.  Sometimes I'll draw with the brush but not often.  A lot of traditionalists in the field of comics prefer brushes for ink--usually not the thicker bamboo I use but a smaller round brush.  You don't need paint, you use it to apply the ink.

4)  Seems like he might be using a small round brush, but the consistency of the line makes me think it could be a pen or nib.  I'm guessing that he achieves the looseness in his lines by holding the pen or brush further back along the stem, rather than close to the point like you do while writing or rendering more tightly.  It's possible that's he's not and has just practiced a looser grip with his lines, but holding the pen differently would certainly help. Again, thanks for clearing up all of my questions! You really are a big help.

I know you‚Äôre probably tired of hearing my questions, and I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm asking you so many! I understand if you don‚Äôt want or can‚Äôt answer my questions. But, I‚Äôm still gonna ask :)
 
**My Questions:**
 
* How do I paint watercolor with my ink drawings? Is there a specific process? Do I apply the paint before or after I draw? Do I need a certain pen / watercolor paint / brush / paper for it? Any additional tips or links would be appreciated.
 
* Someone said that the Sakura pens **clog easily** over watercolor that had dried. Should I be concerned, or is this one of those things that sometimes happens with all pens depending on your luck?
 
* Am I leaving out any important materials that I may need to use that would be helpful? Are there any other art materials that I should get just to test it out?

* I looked through a lot of other brands & products, such as Prismacolor Premier Markers, Faber-Castell Pens, and Pentel Pens. Am I overlooking other pens that are better than the set I chose? Are there other brands that I didn‚Äôt mention that also have better pens?

* I am constantly hearing about the importance to use ‚Äú*heavy paper*‚Äù for watercolor and ink. Specifically, 180 gms or more (I have no idea what that even means!). Gms measurement isn‚Äôt indicated in the amazon link to the watercolor paper I found, which was highly rated. Is it thick enough? Is there a different type of paper I should be using?
 
* Should I buy a better set of brushes than the one that comes with the watercolor set?
 
* If you haven‚Äôt noticed already, I decided not to get a fountain pen yet. I‚Äôm not that interested in lines that change width as I draw. They also seem messy, hard to learn, and only the much better ones are very expensive. Am I making a mistake by not getting one? Are they really that much better than normal pens?
 
* If you want to say any additional info that you think may be helpful for my hunt for the*perfect pens*, then feel free to tell me!
 
If you answer any of these, you would be the coolest person in the world. If you don‚Äôt, thanks for all the help you‚Äôve already given me! **Kudos!**
 Hello there again!  I actually typed up a long response to your question yesterday, but pressed the wrong button and lost everything.  I noticed you asked the same set of questions on r/learnart as well, so sorry if I repeat anything.

> How do I paint watercolor with my ink drawings? Is there a specific process? Do I apply the paint before or after I draw? Do I need a certain pen / watercolor paint / brush / paper for it? Any additional tips or links would be appreciated.

You can either lay the ink lines before you lay the watercolor, or vice versa.  As far as I know, neither is wrong, it's down to whatever works best for you.  My process is: draw first in pencil, ink lines, erase pencil, fill in color, touch up ink as necessary.  I've done it the other way around, but I find when you lay the color first it tends to obscure the pencil lines that serve as the guide.  The downside of the Micron Pigmas with this method (and presumably similar marker pens) is that the ink is not opaque enough to pop through more opaque layers of color, so you may have to retrace your lines.  With India ink this is rarely ever an issue.

My only other tip is to avoid bristol and illustration board for this media technique if you can.  It doesn't hold the watercolor as well and you'll run into problems with multiple washes, etc.  If you can find a hot press watercolor paper in your budget, I recommend it.  The surface is smoother, making it more ideal for pen and ink.

> Someone said that the Sakura pens clog easily over watercolor that had dried. Should I be concerned, or is this one of those things that sometimes happens with all pens depending on your luck?

In my experience, the Sakura Microns are just prone to clogging.  The watercolor no doubt plays into that, but the watercolor paper might affect that as well, since it is made to be more absorbent.  I've found that the finer tips, like .20mm or .25mm, don't clog or dry up as quickly compared to the thicker points, like .45mm or .50mm.  I don't have enough experience with the brush tips to say.

Unfortunately, I have no experience with the Prismacolor, Faber-Castell, or Pentel pens, I'm unable to offer an opinion on those.

> I am constantly hearing about the importance to use ‚Äúheavy paper‚Äù for watercolor and ink. Specifically, 180 gms or more (I have no idea what that even means!). Gms measurement isn‚Äôt indicated in the amazon link to the watercolor paper I found, which was highly rated. Is it thick enough? Is there a different type of paper I should be using?

Gms = grams per square meter, which refers to the weight density of the paper.  You might also see the lb listed.  I checked on the paper you're considering, and Utrecht's website lists it as 140lb, which is equivalent to 300gms, so you're fine.  Most decent quality watercolor papers should meet this requirement.  Like I said, I prefer the hot press, as it's smoother, but it can be harder to locate and more expensive.

> Should I buy a better set of brushes than the one that comes with the watercolor set?

The brush that comes with that set is a portable field brush with a water reservoir.  You may want something larger to fill in areas of color, or something smaller for details.  I would suggest a set of 3-5 acrylic watercolor brushes in a range of sizes.  You can find sets for pretty cheap, just make sure they can handle watercolor.

>If you haven‚Äôt noticed already, I decided not to get a fountain pen yet. I‚Äôm not that interested in lines that change width as I draw. They also seem messy, hard to learn, and only the much better ones are very expensive. Am I making a mistake by not getting one? Are they really that much better than normal pens?

I'm still not sure if by ""fountain pen"" you're talking about a metal nib with holder or a fountain pen for writing.  The latter doesn't strike me as necessary, though I think learning the former is a good idea at some point and not at all expensive.

I think that answers all your questions, but let me know if you have anymore.  I'm always glad to help! /r/learnart

It's always good to hear multiple opinions, because yours was different than the other ones I've heard. Through this whole research process, I understand much more about the materials I'm getting. I'm planning to purchase what I need this afternoon. I have a few more questions:

* I understand the difference between a dip pen and a fountain pen now. What nibs do you recommend (I'm looking for a set so I can test them out and find a preference)? I've heard that there are bendy nibs and stiff nibs. Most people prefer the bendy nibs, but they say it's harder to control them and they're more difficult to use. Basically I'm asking what are good nibs, what should I consider purchasing, and any additional guidance on nibs.

* What Indian ink, paper, dip pen handle, and any other materials do you prefer?

* How do I erase pencil lines under ink? Wouldn't the ink smudge?

 Like I said before, I use Hunt nibs, mostly because that's all I can find locally.  I've heard of some other brands particular to manga/comics artists, but I have no experience with these and couldn't tell you what's good.

If it helps, this is what I use: http://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-crow-quill-dip-pen-and-nibs/

Mainly the #102 and #107 nibs, if I recall, but I do sometimes use a #512 nib for laying thicker lines or working at a larger size.

I started out using the standard pen holder and nibs, i.e. http://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-standard-point-dip-pen-nibs/

I shifted to using the crow quills because while I like the flow on the larger nibs (like #512), they weren't as good for the level of detail I wanted.  The reason I'm suggesting getting a set, rather than anything particular nibs, is that you'll be able to figure out on your own what works best for *you* by practicing with a wide assortment.

I think I already answered some of these questions already?  Maybe in the reply I accidentally deleted?  I use Higgins black India ink on smooth bristol board or hot press illustration board.  I use Pilot Vision extra-fine pens for sketching, and I prefer Moleskin sketchbooks when I can afford them (Strathmore bound sketchbooks when I can't).  No idea what brand of bamboo brush I use, and I use Higgins pen cleaner.

Erase pencil lines after laying the ink.  If you give your ink ample time to dry and use a soft touch, you shouldn't smudge the ink.  I recommend the Mars plastic erasers or a kneaded eraser.";2;https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/26eej1/i_want_to_start_drawing_with_ink_more/;Art;"I want to start drawing with ink, more specifically, the style of hatching. What supplies do I need? I've been really interested in ink artwork, especially hatching. I've been using a normal pilot ink roller ball pen, which can't vary the size of the lines I'm drawing, which is obviously a big setback. I don't even know what to look for. Are fountain pens the best option (and can anyone learn to use them?) Would it be just as fine to use rollerball pens with different sized points? I'm really confused about what I should use, and I would really appreciate any guidance. I would appreciate it even more if you talk about specific products, because I don't have any knowledge about which pens are better than others. Hey, pen & ink artist here.  I might be able to help.

My current tools include a range of metal nibs, bamboo brush, and India ink.  Pretty traditional setup.  If you wanted to try this, you can find inexpensive drawing sets with a range of nibs, and you can get a small bottle of ink.  A smooth bristol board is preferable to the thinner, more absorbent drawing papers used for dry media.  Illustration board is more expensive, but it's my preference, personally.  Especially hot press, which is very smooth.

I'm not entirely sure if this is actually what you mean by ""fountain pens.""  A fountain pen actually refers to a pen with a similar kind of nib, with a reservoir for ink inside the holder.  It's basically the older, more expensive version of a roller ball, and the main advantage would be that the line has more character.  The reason I'd advice against these is that they're not as fine and not as good for hatching/crosshatching.  They're really made for writing.

I use roller balls for sketching, and I think if you wanted to just get familiar with pen & ink, these are a good starting point.  They're cheap, have flow similar to a fountain pen or traditional nib, and are portable.  Major disadvantage is that the ink is not waterproof and probably not archival (edit: well, the Pilot Visions aren't; I have found a rolling ball w/archival ink before, but the tip wasn't fine enough for me and I can't recall the brand).

Another option would be a marker or technical pen.  I've used the Micron Sakuras extensively, and they have the same advantage as the rolling ball in that they're cheap and portable (i.e. don't drip).  The ink in most brands is also waterproof and archival.  The disadvantage is they're closer to a felt tip in terms of flow, and usually don't give you the line character that even a rolling ball or fountain pen provides.  There are pens with brush tips, but I have very little experience with these.  Obviously not what you're looking for if a cross-hatched look is what you're going for.

If you have any further questions, just let me know. Thank you so much! This is very helpful.

I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot, but I have some more questions:

1) Are there any specific products of the items you mention that you prefer or are known to be high quality?

2) I don't understand what I place the metal nibs on.

3) Why do I have to use a bamboo brush? What paint should I use?

4) [What can I do to draw like this guy?](http://bagbosse.tumblr.com/post/86714770120/human-i-am-immaculate-you-are-a-bag-of-meat-if) 1) Speedball is the brand that's probably going to be easiest to find at most art stores.  I use their nibs and holders, mainly because I haven't been able to locate much else locally.  They make ink too, but I mainly use Higgins India ink.  I've been holding on to the same giant bottle for over a year now and planning to scope out a higher quality brand, as I'm dissatisfied with the black coverage.

I buy Utrecht store brand bristol board, but I've used Strathmore as well.  The difference is not that significant, though the latter would be regarded as your higher quality artist's brand.  Smooth is preferable to vellum finish.  As far as illustration board, I like Crescent hot press.

2) A pen holder sized for the type of nib you're using.  This is the one I use for crow quill nibs, which is mainly what I use: http://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-fine-point-dip-pen-nibs-and-holder/

3)  You don't have to use a bamboo brush or a brush at all.  I only use one for covering large areas of flat black.  Sometimes I'll draw with the brush but not often.  A lot of traditionalists in the field of comics prefer brushes for ink--usually not the thicker bamboo I use but a smaller round brush.  You don't need paint, you use it to apply the ink.

4)  Seems like he might be using a small round brush, but the consistency of the line makes me think it could be a pen or nib.  I'm guessing that he achieves the looseness in his lines by holding the pen or brush further back along the stem, rather than close to the point like you do while writing or rendering more tightly.  It's possible that's he's not and has just practiced a looser grip with his lines, but holding the pen differently would certainly help. Again, thanks for clearing up all of my questions! You really are a big help.

I did do some personal research myself, and I narrowed down some items that I wanted to purchase. I want to remind you that I‚Äôm planning to use watercolor with my ink drawings, so if I picked any materials that wouldn‚Äôt work well for this style, please tell me.

I know you‚Äôre probably tired of hearing my questions, and I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm asking you so many! I understand if you don‚Äôt want or can‚Äôt answer my questions. But, I‚Äôm still gonna ask :)
 
**My Questions:**
 
* How do I paint watercolor with my ink drawings? Is there a specific process? Do I apply the paint before or after I draw? Do I need a certain pen / watercolor paint / brush / paper for it? Any additional tips or links would be appreciated.
 
* Someone said that the Sakura pens **clog easily** over watercolor that had dried. Should I be concerned, or is this one of those things that sometimes happens with all pens depending on your luck?
 
* Am I leaving out any important materials that I may need to use that would be helpful? Are there any other art materials that I should get just to test it out?

* I looked through a lot of other brands & products, such as Prismacolor Premier Markers, Faber-Castell Pens, and Pentel Pens. Am I overlooking other pens that are better than the set I chose? Are there other brands that I didn‚Äôt mention that also have better pens?

* I am constantly hearing about the importance to use ‚Äú*heavy paper*‚Äù for watercolor and ink. Specifically, 180 gms or more (I have no idea what that even means!). Gms measurement isn‚Äôt indicated in the amazon link to the watercolor paper I found, which was highly rated. Is it thick enough? Is there a different type of paper I should be using?
 
* Should I buy a better set of brushes than the one that comes with the watercolor set?
 
* If you haven‚Äôt noticed already, I decided not to get a fountain pen yet. I‚Äôm not that interested in lines that change width as I draw. They also seem messy, hard to learn, and only the much better ones are very expensive. Am I making a mistake by not getting one? Are they really that much better than normal pens?
 
* If you want to say any additional info that you think may be helpful for my hunt for the*perfect pens*, then feel free to tell me!
 
If you answer any of these, you would be the coolest person in the world. If you don‚Äôt, thanks for all the help you‚Äôve already given me! **Kudos!**
 Hello there again!  I actually typed up a long response to your question yesterday, but pressed the wrong button and lost everything.  I noticed you asked the same set of questions on r/learnart as well, so sorry if I repeat anything.

> How do I paint watercolor with my ink drawings? Is there a specific process? Do I apply the paint before or after I draw? Do I need a certain pen / watercolor paint / brush / paper for it? Any additional tips or links would be appreciated.

You can either lay the ink lines before you lay the watercolor, or vice versa.  As far as I know, neither is wrong, it's down to whatever works best for you.  My process is: draw first in pencil, ink lines, erase pencil, fill in color, touch up ink as necessary.  I've done it the other way around, but I find when you lay the color first it tends to obscure the pencil lines that serve as the guide.  The downside of the Micron Pigmas with this method (and presumably similar marker pens) is that the ink is not opaque enough to pop through more opaque layers of color, so you may have to retrace your lines.  With India ink this is rarely ever an issue.

My only other tip is to avoid bristol and illustration board for this media technique if you can.  It doesn't hold the watercolor as well and you'll run into problems with multiple washes, etc.  If you can find a hot press watercolor paper in your budget, I recommend it.  The surface is smoother, making it more ideal for pen and ink.

> Someone said that the Sakura pens clog easily over watercolor that had dried. Should I be concerned, or is this one of those things that sometimes happens with all pens depending on your luck?

Help with perspective. ;"So I recently started working a lot on drawing heads from all angles, and one of my main problems is perspective. I can draw heads from different angles if I have a reference, but the main reason I am practicing drawing heads so much is so that I can create my own characters/heads without references and be able to draw them at any angle. What I would like to be able to do is to establish what the character or head looks like, what its features are, its shapes and measurements, and then draw it from any angle. Given that I know its dimensions, I need to be able to figure out how they change when the head is rotated at different angles. When the head angles down, I need to know how to alter the apparent size of the features as the perspective changes. 

After doing some research, I found that I will need to get the hang of two point perspective drawing. My main problem is that I don't know how to position the two perspective points. 

Say I have a rectangular prism. I know its dimensions and how it looks when it's forward plane is facing my face. As it turns to various angles, I will need to use two point perspective to accurately draw it. What I can't figure out is how to establish the perspective points. 

Here is what I have figured out so far: 

The apparent size of the central axis on which the object turns never changes. 

I know this is pretty complicated, but I could really use some help. ";"[this might help](http://www.posemaniacs.com/category/type/face) Loomis has a book called sucessful drawing

You can place the two vanishing points anywhere along the horizon, and shift your object between these two points. This is really good advice.  Practice by focusing on moving the object and not the vanishing points.  Set up a large template for yourself.  A big sheet of paper with a horizon line with a vanishing point at each edge.  Practice drawing the head, on the horizon line, in different spots, but with the same vanishing points.  Also, practice by only using straight lines instead of curves.  That way you will be forced to box in the head structurally.

But I think I would still like to share the pieces that I'm not too ashamed of. Saying that, the only art schooling I've ever had was a class in 7th grade where I mostly didn't learn anything other than perspective lines and vanishing points. Other than that, I've mostly just fumbled my way through trial and error.

I'm quite intimidated by all the great works and artists I see on here that completely outshine anything I could even imagine to draw.

But I think I would still like to share the pieces that I'm not too ashamed of. Saying that, the only art schooling I've ever had was a class in 7th grade where I mostly didn't learn anything other than perspective lines and vanishing points. Other than that, I've mostly just fumbled my way through trial and error.

Anyway, here's imgur links to my stuff.

How does it feel as an artist when a temporary art is damaged by nature or people ?;"My question is regarding arts like sand art, making cakes.

A person who makes sand art spends lot of time in creating a beautiful art even when he/she is fully aware that it lasts long. I understand that they are happy with their passion of creating art, but how does it feel when it's vanished by an unexpected rain or a kid who doesn't know it's value ?

How does a pastry chef feels, when the very artistic cake he made is cut into pieces for eating ? Will he be happy that People are enjoying hos cake or does he feel sad that his art is being wasted ?

Need help with my perspective!;"Hello all artists! I'm studying up on the topic of perspective and with all the sources I find being the same basic info about drawing a box in one, two and three point perspective I'm having trouble finding some answers to my questions. 

Is it possible to have different objects with different types of perspective (one, two, and/or three) in the same image? Like what if you are looking at something in one point but can also see something way far down or tilted with its corner facing you? Would you then make one object one point and another three or two point? Also, at what point does one point perspective become three? Ive seen one point perspective where you see the top or bottom of ""the box"" but at what point do you need to make it three point? Is it only when the object is really tall? Or only when you are facing it's corner and also see the top? 

I'd really appreciate any help I can get as I seem to be consistently stumbling on these issues and I'd like to be able to take my art to the next level. Thanks in advance!";"Essentially what point perspectives do is just work to determine the ""up"" ""side"" and ""back"" directions on the plane the drawing is on.

An example would be a cube, where the front face is shown as a perfect square, but the side of is more of a trapezoid.

Extreme 2-Point Perspective sketch of the Fukuoka Zombie Tower;;"[deleted] Not exactly the original (took a lot of artistic license), but it was fun to do.  I like how you can get crazy angles with linear perspective just by adjusting your vanishing points. do it over again, keep the building the same, make the trees much closer to the horizon, this will make it look a little less wonky.  This a million times....

sometimes wonky looks good, but this time.... wonky just looks wrong. Yes, thank you.  If I hadn't wanted to distort the building, I would have indeed placed the vanishing points farther apart. Fair enough. :)";2;http://i.imgur.com/G0ygo.jpg;Art;"Extreme 2-Point Perspective sketch of the Fukuoka Zombie Tower  [deleted] Not exactly the original (took a lot of artistic license), but it was fun to do.

Perspective Question;"Hi. Maybe this isnt the right sub (if not please direct me to a more appropriate one) but I have a question about perspective (vanishing points - that sort of thing). I get how to do it, thats not my problem, but I am wondering if there is a rule for determining the distance between vertical elements, for example a drawing of power poles trailing off to the horizon, perspective helps determine the diminishing height of the poles as they recede, but what about the distance between the poles? Up to now I have just been eye balling it, but it occurred to me that there might be a more precise means to work this out. 

Hopefully this makes sense as a question, I should have drawn an example for clarity, but my scanner is literally 10s of meters away, so you can see how that isnt an option : P

A discussion on comics and commissions;"I'm going to ramble my way to discussion here-- stick with me if you can.

When I'm not enslaved at a desk for forty hours, I write things. I wrote an animated pilot that got submitted to a few places for review, I've dabbled in some theater, done webcomics, blogging, and most recently I've started writing comic books.

My first book I made with a friend-- I wrote it, he drew it.  There are two issues inked, about five written, and it's currently being colored.  I'd say it has a decent chance of being picked up by an independent publisher, and even if it wasn't picked up as such I think it would attract a readership online at the very least.  The collaboration between the two of us was easy-- it came from mutual admiration towards American-style comics, and we both pushed each other forward.

My second book is in the concept art stage.  I was talking on 4chan about wanting make a second book, and randomly hit the jackpot.  The artist is amazingly involved, responsive, and invested.  Especially for someone who had no reason to be interested in me; a simple belief that I COULD tell a story and the commitment to come along for the ride.

Now I'm hunting to make my third and forth books.  There is an element of me that feels like I'm running ahead of myself, but the reality is in order to become a professional I need to get picked up.  Getting picked up means not stacking all my eggs in one basket.  Great example would be Robert Kirkman-- writer of ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Invincible"".  About the same time he made those books, he pitched two others that he had an equal interest in developing.  They didn't get picked up, and there was nothing to be done about it.  I don't wish this on either of my current projects, but I have little control over it.  I simply have to tell the best story I can, and give it the strongest presentation possible to the publishers. 

Thing is, I find interacting with artists to be... well, it's a bad sign from a writer, but I'm at a loss for words to describe it.  Thus far I've worked with talented individuals who understand there is give and take.  Through acts of stupidity and/or extraordinary trust, there are no contracts in place for our work. I would assume that when someone goes to pick up, we'll negotiate.  I don't foresee this being a problem-- in part because our collaborations are so incredibly well documented (thank God for Gmail).  Most indy publishers don't pay page rates-- they pay percentages.  Once we figure out the best structure to quickly produce with colorists, editors, letterers, etc., my main collaborator and I on each will take our share.  My discussions with both artists on this point have gone very well; ""we'll cross that bridge when we come to it"".  Again, we could be stupid, or we could just be good human beings who understand we need each other.

Anyways, looking at going forward, trying to find a collaborator is hard.  I happened to live with a guy who could draw in college, and I happened to find someone who wasn't a troll on 4chan.  I've lucked into talented assistance.  Heck, assistance undersells them, and that's problem number one I'm finding in my current search.  Artists that want to be undersold.  There are artists who you can just tell have been abused by a writer who didn't give a shit about their opinions.  I don't know what my next project is.  I've got a few ideas, but by God it's going to depend on the talents and enthusiasms found in the person who's going to sweat it out with me.

Secondly, and more vast, are the artists looking just looking for expensive page rates.  Herein is where I'd like to converse with my fellow redditors who might have artistic talent.  What is fair or right about this method that I'm not getting?  I mean, let's say you want me to pay you $50 a page.  I'm going to write the majority of a 22-page comic, and probably ask you to just draw six for pitching purposes.  Let's say the thing gets picked up and is insanely popular.  You're going to want more than $50 a page now.  How is it that my work on the front end is undervalued?  I'm not here to pick a fight on this-- I'm just curious on insight.  I figure we both are committing to taking a chance on each other.  It's a relationship-- so why am I always paying for dinner?  

(By the by, I'm going to skip discussion on the third type of artist-- bad Bleach fanboys and girls.  This is not relevant to the conversation-- it is just sad.  The amount of people who cannot draw is probably exactly the same amount as the folks who cannot write, and may they leave the rest of us alone.)";"""I figure we both are committing to taking a chance on each other. It's a relationship-- so why am I always paying for dinner?""

Because *you're* the one who's decided it's time to eat and *you're* the one that's dictating what you two will be ordering.

If you're lucky enough to find a talented cartoonist who just really digs your writing and is willing to ""throw in"" with you, that's fantastic.  But, if you're expecting someone to spend time drawing *your* story, it's reasonable for that person to expect to receive some sort of payment. There's also a vast time/work differential b/t writing a 22 pg book and drawing a 22pg book. This is why somebody like Brian Bendis can write like 80% of Marvel's books each month, but it takes three or four guys per book do to art on a monthly.

Also, note that most (but certainly not all) indie publishers want to see a mostly-completed project, not just a few sample pages.  This is especially true if you're a relative unknown and don't have a ""track record"" of successfully completed projects.

Best of luck with your project(s).  Maybe post some sample pages here when you've got them. I'm sure folks would love to see them.

-B.  I guess I'm not looking at it as them drawing my book, as it is them drawing our book.  I'm not deciding the book ahead of time, I'm certainly not dictating.  Both books I've gone through extensive re-writes to find the realm my artist finds most enjoyable.  Now, I don't deny I can write twenty two pages faster than they can physically draw them (although I think sometimes people might be surprised how excruciating the writing process can be)-- but isn't that something to take up on the back end?

I must learn. Any advice for a complete beginner?  Hey I also am a pen collector

Pen collector bros I purchased a Calligraphy Book that included several types of pens. I also found free practice drills online for printing. 

Practice. Practice. Practice. 

***and Patience!***

Good Luck! 

(are you related to the Pucketts with the amazing tree house referenced in this note?) Fix up your posture and your pen grip. Do practice drills regularly of individual letters in the styles you want to learn. Expect this to take a long time. Lots of advice to get stuff however read the Beginners Guide on the side first. It has lots of recommendations, advice and studyguides. A geat place to start. Looks like elvish! So pretty Hello lad. Just give a look in the Wiki of the community.

How to best get started with Spencerian;"I have a couple decent fountain pens and would really like to put them to work properly. Are there any books/videos/etc. that you think are particularly helpful.

You don't have to bother with the shading etc, just learn the forms with the pens you have.

That can write an A for example, thin on the upstroke of the left line and then because it‚Äôs flat and the way you hold it, the down stroke of the A is thick? 

What kind of pen could do that? I hope this isn‚Äôt too basic a question, and Amazon examples more than welcome.

The Ink I wish I had when I started!;"
I have been doing broad edge Calligraphy for about a year now and finally got my nibs in some Winsor and Newton Calligraphy Ink, and it‚Äôs by far been the smoothest writing ink out of the bottle for broad edge dip nibs. 


This picture was just a quick dip test using a Leonardt Round England nib on Strathmore 400 drawing paper. 


Other inks+ I have tried so far:

Higgins Eternal

Ziller Soot Black

Yasutomo Ultra Black/Silver Black

Holbein Artist Goauche

Schmincke Calligraphy Goauche

Dr. Ph. Martin‚Äôs Iridescent Calligraphy Colors (Copperplate Gold)

Daler Rowney FW Pearlescent Acrylic

JNB Walnut Ink Crystals

Fox and Quills Iron Gall - Red Wine (great for pointed pen)

Stick Ink / Misc. Sumi (no english text) 

Many Many Fountain Pen Inks including:

Pelikan 4001

Pilot Iroshizuku

Herbin (Emerald of Chivor)

Colorverse

Sailor Pigmented Black

Sailor Ink Studio

Diamine Diamine Diamine

Dominant Industry

Monteverde Joy (which seemed to work great for PA Scribe in a YouTube video but was still runny for me)

Birmingham Pen Co. 

And before I knew any better, adding gum Arabic to fountain pen ink and/or letting it evaporate (neither of which actually help with dye based fountain pen inks according to my experience and people smarter than me that have explained why in other threads here). 


The Winsor and Newton ink can still blob on first stroke if the nib is too saturated, but I anticipate that with a scratch paper and brush to load, this would be mitigated. 


Hopefully this will help some other scribes dipping their nibs into the world of broad edge calligraphy. This is also not to say the other inks aren‚Äôt viable, just more fussy in my experience. I wish I had this ink a year ago because it feels like easy mode now! Of course everyone will also have their own preferences and paper, nib, and experience level all come into play. 


I also haven‚Äôt yet tried a few recommended inks such as Best Bottle or Moon Palace Sumi. I also haven‚Äôt tried inks I haven‚Äôt seen recommended like Speedball Calligraphy Ink, Diamine Calligraphy Ink, Sailor Dipton, and I‚Äôm sure many others. So your mileage may vary!

Cheers and write on! 

?üñ§ Lambro aka dark.scribe";"Also shoutout to u/Crafty-Ad9060 (Majestic Manuscripts) for the recommendation for this ink! Thanks! I also own a lot of the w&n India inks. I agree, they're just fantastic. Easily the cleanest India ink on the market, doesn't gunk or destroy your nib. I use them for my Ackerman.  Outside of gouache I'd say this is some of the best ink you can get. Good move! It's acrylic, which does make things easier, I think - and at about the right consistency, maybe just a smidge too thick. And it's not soo acrylic that it goops up annoyingly like the Talens acrylics, nor like shellac. Acrylic is my go-to for any paper that isn't watercolour paper (and even some that calls itself so undeservingly but still feathers nastily :P). The colours are a bit limited but the ones they have are very satisfying. Try Liquitex for some similar inks in different colours. I got Liquitex's black  in a larger size and it's been good value as it doesn't feather on almost anything, so I can practice on mid paper. 

People say acrylic can ""corrode"" your nibs but I haven't found these to be worse than anything else, air will corrode steel eventually. You might also feel it's unhistorical but practicing on dogshit cellulose paper is also somewhat unhistorical. ""We do what we must, because we can."" One other ink you may really like is the Winsor Newton Liquid Indian Ink. It is made from ink sticks, and has no shellac. Trouble is, you have to be careful to read the name carefully - the bottle and box look really similar to their black India Ink, which is NOT the one you want. Dilute with a few drops of distilled water if it seems too thick. Also, wipe down your nibs with  gum Arabic before you start writing,  to help with the blobbing without having to add gum Arabic to your ink or gouache. I also have McCaffery‚Äôs Penman ink but haven‚Äôt tried it yet, however it‚Äôs not recommended for broad edge.

Please ignore the extra o on Winsor. Titivillus made another unwanted appearance when I was warming up here. ?üëπ

Also sorry for the repost if anyone saw the previous version. Accidentally uploaded the un-cropped, non-color-corrected photo. Is it okay for left handed people to use this Yes! I'm glad you like them as much as I do ?üòç as a tip when using the white, I always pour some into a small cap and add some water as I find it too thick to write smoothly with it ?üëå
And yeah I always just touch the top of the ink to get most of the excess ink off the nib then do a few lines in a scrappy note book so it doesn't come on too heavy ?üòÉ
Cool work as well man?üëå I'm glad I have finally found something I *really* *like*.

Ackerman pens look cool. I would like to try one some day.

When I first started, I followed the information in the r/Calligraphy  [Beginner's Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/beginners/#wiki_ink), and I think this had lead me to avoid India inks for some time:

>For beginners, we recommend **walnut ink** or **sumi ink** for both pointed and broad styles. Walnut ink is easier to wash off, and has a nice brown colour. Sumi ink has a very dense black quality. Both can be washed off with water, though sumi may be a bit more stubborn once dried onto your nibs. If you want colour, you can go for **gouache** (pronounced ""gwash""), a form of opaque watercolour.

>Both sumi and gouache should be diluted, ideally with distilled water. For sumi, try a 1:4 ink:water dilution; for gouache, stir in enough water to hit the consistency of whole milk. Play around with dilution levels to find something that works for you.

>Walnut ink can be sold straight, or in solid crystals. If you're using liquid walnut ink, it's ready as-is. For crystals, follow packaging directions to dissolve them in water.

>Whatever you do, do NOT buy waterproof ink! This includes any ink with shellac and nearly all inks marked as India ink. They will corrode the metal of your nibs and are difficult to clean.

I'm not sure how much worse Yasutomo is than Best Bottle or Moon Palace, but I found it to be really frustrating to work with. After trying the recommended 1:4 ratio, (which was WAY TOO DILUTED for this particular ink), I tried it out of the bottle and also made several dilutions at 10% increments (9ml ink to 1ml dH20; 8ml ink to 2ml dH20... etc.) and it just never seemed to flow well for broad edge, and would gunk up the nib incredibly quickly. To be fair, I also haven't used it since I first started out, and I haven't tried the two most recommended brands.

Walnut ink was OK, but it wasn't BLACK, and the shading wasn't really what I was going for at the time. I'm not sure how the liquid walnut ink compares to the crystals.

Recently I have been practicing with gouache more, and like it for pointed pen, but have had mixed results for broad edge. I may just not be wiping my nib enough, but it will do a few nice letters, then give me a smudgy edge. However, I have been using a plastic watercolor dish and watched [a video by Patricia Lovett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx5E1JYCYIE) recently where she suggested it's is too wide and would cause the water in the gouache to evaporate too quickly. So I am going to try with a [dappen dish](https://www.johnnealbooks.com/product/dappen-dish-with-metal-lid) and see if that helps my consistency.

All that being said, I'm more excited than ever to use my broad nibs now, and look forward to collecting more of the W&N inks. I have mostly been using parallel pens for convenience, but they have their own issues and short comings. If nothing else, calligraphy has certainly taught me to be more patient.

I do however wish that this ink was recommended in the wiki, because it's exactly what I have been trying to find for a year now. I do also want to be respectful of the history, and even plan to learn to cut and use quills eventually, but in another perspective, scribes used what was available to them at the time. So in that way we are sort of doing the same thing. Perhaps a smidge thick but certainly the closest to bottle ready I have found. I don‚Äôt have Talens, but Daley Rowner acrylic would gunk up annoyingly. Thanks for the Liquitex recommendation! I‚Äôm not too worried about corrosion. Nibs are the cheapest part of this hobby for me. ?üòÇ Thanks! Straight to jail. Thanks! I will keep that in mind when I pick up some white. I didn‚Äôt initially plan to post this, but I was too exited about how crisp the lines are with this ink and how easy it is to use. Aye I also struggle with yasutomo sometimes hahaha. On the walnut ink, I use Tom Norton's walnut ink I'd rank it as the best performing ink money can buy. ? Yeah they're such good inks?üòç I haven't used any other branded ones so I can't compare, but this just work amazing for what I do?üòÉ I‚Äôm guessing the crystals don‚Äôt hold up to Tom Norton‚Äôs. Have you tried it for broad edge or just pointed pen? Just joking. I‚Äôm not aware of any rules regarding what inks left handed people can use. I would guess it‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt run your hand over it immediately after. Your pieces always look really clean. I‚Äôm looking forward to producing more finished work now that I‚Äôm getting my tools locked in. Both and I've had excellent results with both.  It's more expensive than crystals but it's perfect straight out of the bottle. And also the cleanest ink around. Can't wait to see them?üòç";54;https://i.redd.it/ugs6nbn1oajd1.jpeg;Calligraphy;"The Ink I wish I had when I started! 
I have been doing broad edge Calligraphy for about a year now and finally got my nibs in some Winsor and Newton Calligraphy Ink, and it‚Äôs by far been the smoothest writing ink out of the bottle for broad edge dip nibs. 


This picture was just a quick dip test using a Leonardt Round England nib on Strathmore 400 drawing paper. 


Other inks+ I have tried so far:

Higgins Eternal

Ziller Soot Black

Yasutomo Ultra Black/Silver Black

Holbein Artist Goauche

Schmincke Calligraphy Goauche

Dr. Ph. Martin‚Äôs Iridescent Calligraphy Colors (Copperplate Gold)

Daler Rowney FW Pearlescent Acrylic

JNB Walnut Ink Crystals

Fox and Quills Iron Gall - Red Wine (great for pointed pen)

Stick Ink / Misc. Sumi (no english text) 

Many Many Fountain Pen Inks including:

Pelikan 4001

Pilot Iroshizuku

Herbin (Emerald of Chivor)

Colorverse

Sailor Pigmented Black

Sailor Ink Studio

Diamine Diamine Diamine

Dominant Industry

Monteverde Joy (which seemed to work great for PA Scribe in a YouTube video but was still runny for me)

Birmingham Pen Co. 

And before I knew any better, adding gum Arabic to fountain pen ink and/or letting it evaporate (neither of which actually help with dye based fountain pen inks according to my experience and people smarter than me that have explained why in other threads here). 


The Winsor and Newton ink can still blob on first stroke if the nib is too saturated, but I anticipate that with a scratch paper and brush to load, this would be mitigated. 


Hopefully this will help some other scribes dipping their nibs into the world of broad edge calligraphy. This is also not to say the other inks aren‚Äôt viable, just more fussy in my experience.

Kakimori help;Hey everybody, I'm a newbie to this and want a nicer pen nibble holder to get started. The kakimori caught my eye however, I need a 2mm nib and 3mm nib. I didn't see that they have this option. Will any nib fit with it? Are there other nib holders that are nice I should check out ? All the help is welcomed thank you. ;"Go on jetpens dot com, look up the product type you want, and click on the 'recommended refills/parts' button to see what nibs will fit into the holder. As for suggestions, I personally use a Tachikawa T-25 and it's been great. Kakimori is meant for fountain pen users, not really a calligraphy thing....Yes you can fit other nibs on it, but for that price? I don't see the point. I will do this thank you I second the Tachikawa recommendation. It fits most Brause and Speedball nibs that I need for spencerian and blackletter. I don't have a Kakimori nib yet, but want one for swatching inks. Given the versatility, I think it will fit in the Tachikawa holder. 

Op, Tachikawa has holders with and without rubber grips. The wood is Grippy enough so don't get the rubber grip ones unless you clutch the holder really tightly while writing. So what would you recommend instead? Are there any specifically for calligraphy with a more...unique look? Okay thank you, I definitely take a look. Decide what hand you would like to do first? You need different things for Fraktur vs Copperplate, for example.

I would recommend study this sub's wiki and beginners guide. Definitely Fraktur For any broad edge calligraphy, Pilot Parallel is great for beginners.

If you want dip pens and  fancy holders, check Etsy? Personally I'd rather spend money on nibs than holders so maybe someone else can help here. Okay I'll look into the pilot parallel then.

Putting together a kit for my girlfriend, I'm totally new to this, would love some feedback!;"Firstly, I have absolutely no clue about anything related to calligraphy other than what I've researched in the last couple hours. I want to get her set up with a proper kit that does not break the bank but also allows her to get a true feel for the craft.  I don't want her to be in the boat of thinking she doesn't like it when in reality it's either the wrong tools or just crappy tools.

She loves to doodle and write words/phrases in her journals/calendars. She plays around with different fonts and tries to mimic calligraphy so I will give her the real deal. She's very much into Victorian era Britain, old school vintage style trinkets, clothes, etc. She uses a pen a lot for her job, so she understands the value in a good quality pen. She loves doing stuff like handwriting letters and sealing them with wax stamps.

Are there specific recommendations for someone interested in the Victorian era?

I've put together a list of items that I think should be a good starting point, but again...I'm as ignorant on this topic as they come! I'd really appreciate some feedback and advice. I'm confident that she will dive into anything I get, so I'm less worried about getting ""too much"" in the beginning. Also, part of the reason I'm making a larger kit is because I don't know what style she would even gravitate towards. Why not give her a bit of a smorgasbord?

So far, I have:

I'm considering an oblique nib holder as I read in a few places that it was a game changer and greatly increased some people's enjoyment. I'm thinking something cheap like this, just for the feel:

I feel like there's a lot of knick-knack quality of life stuff that you only learn about later or don't think to get as a beginner. Any recommendations on that end? For example, an ink pad something to work on. Thanks in advance!";"I recommend going to [John Neal Books](https://www.johnnealbooks.com) and procuring a set of [Suzanne Cunningham‚Äôs recommended nibs](https://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/suzanne-cunningham-favorite-pointed-nibs/) along with a simple [oblique pen holder](https://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/oblique-penholders/). John Neal sells quality products so even their cheapest pen holder should do the trick for a beginner.

Important to note that my recommendations are for pointed pen scripts specifically (copperplate, engrosser‚Äôs script, other round hand styles). Suzanne‚Äôs set has a bunch of different nibs to help you understand what works for you. The Zebra nib is probably the most approachable for a beginner. 

For broad-edge pen calligraphy I would recommend a straight pen holder and something like a Speedball nib set.

I use Ziller inks personally. An Iron Gall ink could also work well for the handwritten Victorian vibe but you do have to be diligent about cleaning your nib when you‚Äôre done because the acid in the iron gall ink can erode the nib over time. The only thing I have to add is paper. John Neal has practice pads for calligraphy. Also they ahve some good introductory texts. And also check out their classes page. We've taken a few classes based on the links on their page.

Also, my wife loves her light box / pad. I got her an inexpensive one on Amazon for \~$20. They are sold as aids to tracing. It serves to both give a nice backlight to the paper but also a nice flat surface. I got one that is rechargeable, so it doesn't have to be plugged in. Speedball nibs are good. They also make markers with a calligraphy point, which can be good for doodling. this is so sweet!! 

anws, calligraphy can be broken down into two sections - broadedged scripts (think gothic/blocky letters. e.g. of such script would be fraktur/italic) & pointed pen scripts (think cursive/loopy letters. e.g. of such script would be copperplate/engrosser‚Äôs script). the stuff you use for both are sliiightly different. 

most of the items in your main list seem to be heading towards the broadedged side of things. the parallel pen is great for learning broadedged scripts, i enjoy using it a lot. on the other hand, i don‚Äôt particularly enjoy using the speedball nibs, have tried them multiple times but still can‚Äôt seem to enjoy them lol ymmv tho. 

as for the oblique holder, it‚Äôs usually more of a pointed pen thing (though i have seen it being used with the round speedball nibs as well, don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve seen it used with the square ones). 

so it would realllly depend on which type she‚Äôs interested in :-) or if it‚Äôs both, you could consider getting a sampler pack of pointed pen nibs to go along with the oblique holder. 

and if she‚Äôs interested in the pointed pen scripts, another thing you could possibly look into would be brush pens (e.g. pentel fude touch). 

&& also, a site worth checking out would be johnnealbooks or paperinkarts, i believe they have sampler packs for pointed pen nibs? 

((sorry for the rambles hahahah))

eta: forgot to mention about the monoline nibs from the speedball pack - those are pretty fun too! i use them more for cursive style scripts, but they‚Äôre basically just a really thick round pen - kinda like those round tipped marker pens haha. you can look up @bechori777 on ig to see some sample scripts, he‚Äôs great at using them.

I picked up this [tombow advanced lettering kit](https://www.tombowusa.com/letteringincolor.html) that included some brush pens which she has really enjoyed experimenting with Wikipedia has more info but basically:

>Iron gall ink is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from vegetable sources.

Firstly, I have absolutely no clue about anything related to calligraphy other than what I've researched in the last couple hours. I want to get her set up with a proper kit that does not break the bank but also allows her to get a true feel for the craft.  I don't want her to be in the boat of thinking she doesn't like it when in reality it's either the wrong tools or just crappy tools.

She loves to doodle and write words/phrases in her journals/calendars. She plays around with different fonts and tries to mimic calligraphy so I will give her the real deal. She's very much into Victorian era Britain, old school vintage style trinkets, clothes, etc. She uses a pen a lot for her job, so she understands the value in a good quality pen. She loves doing stuff like handwriting letters and sealing them with wax stamps.

Are there specific recommendations for someone interested in the Victorian era?

I've put together a list of items that I think should be a good starting point, but again...I'm as ignorant on this topic as they come! I'd really appreciate some feedback and advice. I'm confident that she will dive into anything I get, so I'm less worried about getting ""too much"" in the beginning. Also, part of the reason I'm making a larger kit is because I don't know what style she would even gravitate towards. Why not give her a bit of a smorgasbord?

So far, I have:

I'm considering an oblique nib holder as I read in a few places that it was a game changer and greatly increased some people's enjoyment. I'm thinking something cheap like this, just for the feel:

I feel like there's a lot of knick-knack quality of life stuff that you only learn about later or don't think to get as a beginner. Any recommendations on that end? For example, an ink pad something to work on. Thanks in advance! I recommend going to [John Neal Books](https://www.johnnealbooks.com) and procuring a set of [Suzanne Cunningham‚Äôs recommended nibs](https://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/suzanne-cunningham-favorite-pointed-nibs/) along with a simple [oblique pen holder](https://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/oblique-penholders/). John Neal sells quality products so even their cheapest pen holder should do the trick for a beginner.

Important to note that my recommendations are for pointed pen scripts specifically (copperplate, engrosser‚Äôs script, other round hand styles). Suzanne‚Äôs set has a bunch of different nibs to help you understand what works for you. The Zebra nib is probably the most approachable for a beginner. 

For broad-edge pen calligraphy I would recommend a straight pen holder and something like a Speedball nib set.

I use Ziller inks personally. An Iron Gall ink could also work well for the handwritten Victorian vibe but you do have to be diligent about cleaning your nib when you‚Äôre done because the acid in the iron gall ink can erode the nib over time. The only thing I have to add is paper. John Neal has practice pads for calligraphy. Also they ahve some good introductory texts. And also check out their classes page. We've taken a few classes based on the links on their page.

Also, my wife loves her light box / pad. I got her an inexpensive one on Amazon for \~$20. They are sold as aids to tracing. It serves to both give a nice backlight to the paper but also a nice flat surface. I got one that is rechargeable, so it doesn't have to be plugged in. Speedball nibs are good. They also make markers with a calligraphy point, which can be good for doodling. this is so sweet!! 

anws, calligraphy can be broken down into two sections - broadedged scripts (think gothic/blocky letters. e.g. of such script would be fraktur/italic) & pointed pen scripts (think cursive/loopy letters. e.g. of such script would be copperplate/engrosser‚Äôs script). the stuff you use for both are sliiightly different. 

most of the items in your main list seem to be heading towards the broadedged side of things. the parallel pen is great for learning broadedged scripts, i enjoy using it a lot. on the other hand, i don‚Äôt particularly enjoy using the speedball nibs, have tried them multiple times but still can‚Äôt seem to enjoy them lol ymmv tho. 

as for the oblique holder, it‚Äôs usually more of a pointed pen thing (though i have seen it being used with the round speedball nibs as well, don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve seen it used with the square ones). 

so it would realllly depend on which type she‚Äôs interested in :-) or if it‚Äôs both, you could consider getting a sampler pack of pointed pen nibs to go along with the oblique holder. 

and if she‚Äôs interested in the pointed pen scripts, another thing you could possibly look into would be brush pens (e.g. pentel fude touch). 

&& also, a site worth checking out would be johnnealbooks or paperinkarts, i believe they have sampler packs for pointed pen nibs? 

((sorry for the rambles hahahah))

eta: forgot to mention about the monoline nibs from the speedball pack - those are pretty fun too! i use them more for cursive style scripts, but they‚Äôre basically just a really thick round pen - kinda like those round tipped marker pens haha. you can look up @bechori777 on ig to see some sample scripts, he‚Äôs great at using them. I'd put in a vote for a set of Pilot Parallel pens.  It includes ink cartridges and some instructions.  Also a bleed-proof practise pad, A3. This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

When to make the jump to dip pens?!;I'm currently playing around with a pilot parallel pen for italic and using a pencil for pointed-pen stuff (copperplate mostly). I'm happy using the pilot pen for the broad-edge stuff but I feel like the pencil, while it does give thicks and thins isn't ideal. I'm still fairly new and learning the ropes - at what point should I take the plunge on a dip pen? What are your experiences of transitioning to the 'proper' stuff?;"Any time you want. They're actually how I first learned, back in middle school art class. Our teacher had us using Speedball C nibs and India ink.

Dip pens are a little fussy, but nothing a novice can't use. Just go for it! I made the jump about a week after owning and playing with my own fountain pen, with a few brush lettering practices behind me. It's definitely a learning curve, but once you get it, it's fun. 

I do want to point out I made a rookie mistake, and nabbed a speedball plastic oblique pen....Don't do that if you are right-handed and looking to try an oblique dip pen. Get one that  has a brass flange (the part that holds the nib pen.)  Also, the speedball came with 6 Hunt brand nibs, four 101s and 2 103s, and out of the six, three were useable--the rest had misaligned nibs that caught terribly on every piece of paper I had for upstrokes or circles, no matter how I did it. Try getting Zebra brand nibs or Nikko G's, as they're great for beginners. Just jump in!

I would add that you should try the Sumi ink or Walnut brown...I forget who makes that just now(I'm at work and cant go look at it.) Both those inks are very good. Walnut ink: get the crystals. Just add warm water and let dissolve. I went straight to them from zero. No regrets, just took a little getting used to. And being able to use an antique pewter inkwell at my great-great aunt‚Äôs 19th-century writing desk just feels so cool.

Also, nibs are cheap, and it‚Äôs fun to try out different ones until you discover what you like the best. When you start Call John Neal Booksellers‚Ä¶they have great customer service! For pointed pen calligraphy, I enjoy both the Jaipur 2 Ultraflex fountain pen from Fountain Pen Revolution, and the nib sampler and holder I got from John Neal Books. Wait for at least a 20% off sale from FPR, though, they come around fairly regularly. Ok, I‚Äôve pushed the button on an oblique nib holder (¬£13 from Etsy), a Nikko G nib and a pot of walnut ink. I am on the same boat for the first part as well, however, since I couldn't find any decent obliques in any shops nearby I went to Etsy and got myself a bullock flange one (Maybe at too steep of a price for a beginner but it's looked so awesome I couldn't pass up on it, it kept being stuck on my mind from the moment I saw that holder), I also got the Brause Rose and 66EFs since I like EF nibs. I‚Äôve seen walnut ink recommended before. Diluting crystals sounds added faff! What‚Äôs the benefit of that over pre-mixed stuff? My biggest problem from using pilot parallel pens is finding paper that doesn‚Äôt bleed. Is there a fairly inexpensive paper for practising?

Speedball being one that come us time and again. Sorry for the delay in responding. The benefit is the rich color and the way it flows. You can make it quite dark and when it tints out with water the shading is beautiful. It is stable when dry so it works well with watercolor overlays. John Neal Books carries my favorite, and it is not expensive. I use Canson marker pads for practice. Not the cheapest, but it‚Äôs good stuff, and it‚Äôs thin enough that you can put a guide sheet underneath and still follow the lines. It‚Äôs a French brand, so if I can get it here in the states, I imagine it must be available in the UK (though I guess anything‚Äôs possible post-Brexit). How do you like the Canson paper?

I‚Äôm also new & not really enjoying my parallel pens as much as I thought I would. I bought 2 sizes‚Äî the orange cap (2.4mm) & the green (larger size but not largest). 

I just feel like the ink cartridges go by fairly quickly from all the practicing I‚Äôm doing, but I also don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting much better considering how much I‚Äôve been practicing. 

I probably just need to be more patient. If I had a bigger budget for artistic hobbies, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be stressing about blowing through ink cartridges left & right. ;)

I‚Äôve been writing on Rhodia notebook paper but hate wasting notebook pages to practice. 
Also I found a pad of Kohinoor (?) brand marker paper on clearance at Walmart, it‚Äôs smooth but I really enjoy the thickness. (Whereas Rhodia paper is very thin.) Just ordered a pad!

It‚Äôs also quite smooth. I‚Äôm no connoisseurs so I can‚Äôt really comment on other aspects. I just like that fact that it‚Äôs quite transparent.

[Constructive Criticism] Started a Calligraphy course four weeks ago. This was last night's practice.;;"Pens - pilot parallels, ink- pilot mixable, 1.5mm nib. Tomoe River paper. No exemplar, just the handouts our prof has given us.   Foundational. You are doing a fantastic job! It looks great!  I do not do calligraphy but I am an artist so I can try to help the best I can! 

I think it looks really lovely, I enjoy how well you blend the colours together (Pinky & the brain being my favourite of this example.) but there are a few things I did notice when looking closer. There are a few letters I think you need to work on just a touch. S, Lowercase A, Lowercase E, and J. 
Those letters seem to change their shape every time they are written and change in length in specific parts even if they are in the same word if that makes sense. Other than that, the only problem I see is when you are doing the & sign. That's about it. I think it looks really lovely though and for how long you claim to be practicing I think you will grow better extremely quickly! I hope I was helpful.  I think this is awesome! This is so beautiful! First of all, this is great for just four weeks of studying calligraphy! It's really cool that you pay great attention to details. Loved your &'s :)

Though, there's still room for improvement. Spend some time with those o's and letters that have circles in them. The key is to make them firm and taut ‚Äî make sure they don't wiggle where the stroke is thin and stand firmly on the baseline. You can do this by adding energy to your strokes. Make a stroke in one solid movement from point A to point B. 

Find a good shape for 'e', in foundational it's made of three strokes ‚Äî bottom bowl, top cap and a horizontal bar just above the midline.
I also suspect that you have invented some of the capital letters :) Look them up, they are different a tad. Or pm me for good examples.

Overall, really nice work. Keep it up and share your progress here.
 I see Mulder and Scully ;)))))) > Sam & Dean

The Winchester boys, right? Harold & Maude? I don't have any tips since I am quite new, but I am a little jealous right now. I tried finding a calligraphy class I could take weekly or at my college, but there isn't anything within a 10 mile radius nor does my school offer a calligraphy class :(
Keep up the good work! do you use mutiple pens for multiple colors? You are getting better with the ampersand, heh heh! Good job! First, congratulations on your progress and for taking a class.  As a calligraphy teacher, it is much easier to show a stroke rather than having to describe it.  I look forward to seeing more of your progress..... No Benson and Stabler? I've got a semi.  At first glance these looked impossibly perfect to me‚Äî A+ eyes, friend! This helped me too! You're awesomely helpful. I'm not nearly as good as OP but kind criticism makes a world of difference to a talented student such as OP. Thanks. Funnily enough the ones you've picked out are the ones I've been struggling with, except the j, I'll have to look at those! I think maybe the handout he gave us he kept the capitals a little easier to begin with. I definitely didn't ""make them up"". He usually starts us with easy things then when we get the hang of it adds elements to make it nicer. I do have a different sheet he gave us that I've noticed the capitals are a little bit different. Came here for this lol. ?ü§ò?üèª I was trying to practice proper nouns as we just started learning capitals week before last. It is from a ""famous duos"" page I found.  Anyway, great job! The course I'm taking is actually at a college about 25 miles from my house but it's pretty close to my work, so it's great because I can just go there straight after work. Yes and no. The way the pilot parallels work, you take two pens with different inks in them and briefly touch the nibs together, holding one pointing up and one pointing down. The ink from the top one flows down into the bottom one and that colour takes over for a short time, then you get a mix of the two for a bit, then the original comes back. You can even do it with several colours. Didn't actually watch Law and Order enough to get that one, had to Google it! Same here, but I wanted to take a closer look and looked at all the letters individually and found that. Thank you, and I am glad I can be helpful!   Why thank you. Very true. OP is doing really well.  Of course. The J isn't bad at all it's just every once in a while so. Yeah. I am glad I could be of some help.  25 miles ‚âà 40 km

";476;https://imgur.com/qTcM2qG;Calligraphy;"[Constructive Criticism] Started a Calligraphy course four weeks ago. This was last night's practice.  Pens - pilot parallels, ink- pilot mixable, 1.5mm nib. Tomoe River paper. No exemplar, just the handouts our prof has given us.   Foundational. You are doing a fantastic job! It looks great!  I do not do calligraphy but I am an artist so I can try to help the best I can! 

I think it looks really lovely, I enjoy how well you blend the colours together (Pinky & the brain being my favourite of this example.) but there are a few things I did notice when looking closer. There are a few letters I think you need to work on just a touch. S, Lowercase A, Lowercase E, and J. 
Those letters seem to change their shape every time they are written and change in length in specific parts even if they are in the same word if that makes sense. Other than that, the only problem I see is when you are doing the & sign. That's about it. I think it looks really lovely though and for how long you claim to be practicing I think you will grow better extremely quickly! I hope I was helpful.  I think this is awesome! This is so beautiful! First of all, this is great for just four weeks of studying calligraphy! It's really cool that you pay great attention to details. Loved your &'s :)

Though, there's still room for improvement. Spend some time with those o's and letters that have circles in them. The key is to make them firm and taut ‚Äî make sure they don't wiggle where the stroke is thin and stand firmly on the baseline. You can do this by adding energy to your strokes. Make a stroke in one solid movement from point A to point B. 

Find a good shape for 'e', in foundational it's made of three strokes ‚Äî bottom bowl, top cap and a horizontal bar just above the midline.
I also suspect that you have invented some of the capital letters :) Look them up, they are different a tad. Or pm me for good examples.

Overall, really nice work. Keep it up and share your progress here.
 I see Mulder and Scully ;)))))) > Sam & Dean

The Winchester boys, right? Harold & Maude? I don't have any tips since I am quite new, but I am a little jealous right now. I tried finding a calligraphy class I could take weekly or at my college, but there isn't anything within a 10 mile radius nor does my school offer a calligraphy class :(
Keep up the good work! do you use mutiple pens for multiple colors? You are getting better with the ampersand, heh heh! Good job! First, congratulations on your progress and for taking a class.  As a calligraphy teacher, it is much easier to show a stroke rather than having to describe it.  I look forward to seeing more of your progress..... No Benson and Stabler? I've got a semi.  At first glance these looked impossibly perfect to me‚Äî A+ eyes, friend! This helped me too! You're awesomely helpful. I'm not nearly as good as OP but kind criticism makes a world of difference to a talented student such as OP. Thanks. Funnily enough the ones you've picked out are the ones I've been struggling with, except the j, I'll have to look at those! I think maybe the handout he gave us he kept the capitals a little easier to begin with. I definitely didn't ""make them up"".

Study Sessions - Foundational - Part 1;"##Welcome 
&nbsp;

We have been getting a lot of questions about how to get started with calligraphy.  We did some study sessions on here are while back and we thought this would be worth a try. We chose Foundational for our first script because it's a great one for people to get started with.  It's set up in a way so you don't need any calligraphy experience to do it.  So if you already have some experience this first week will be recap stuff but it's important to cover. 

There are 4 parts, we will post 1 a week on Monday's.

Plus there is a prize!! Anyone who completes all the exercises will earn a special ""Foundational"" user flair.  

If you have any questions about anything as we go feel free to post them in here. 

&nbsp;

##**Foundational**

----

&nbsp;

##Part 1 - Getting Started

####Intro to Foundational

The Foundational script was created by Edward Johnson.  It was modified from English Carolingian into a more modern form.  It is widely considered to be one of the best scripts for beginners to start with.  

####Key Points

-It is mostly commonly done with an x-height of 4 or 4 ¬Ω.  With ascenders and descenders at 1 ¬Ω  or 2.  

-The pen angle is mostly at 30 deg but the diagonal stroke of the **v**, **w** and **x** are done at 45 deg.

[-The most important letters are **o** and **n**. The **o** is based on a circle and the **n** sets the arches and the counters. Foundational Minimum by u/ucawmanuscript](http://i.imgur.com/ZhegfK2.jpg)

####Pen, Paper and Ink

There are a lot of possibilities here. This is some general information about what you can use for this but if you already have some stuff you can probably use that.

**Pen:**

If you are brand new to Calligraphy the Pilot Parallel Pens are very useful tools.  For people new to this there can be a lot of different things to learn at once and it can be a bit overwhelming. This is a very easy to use tool that will simplify things and can help you focus on writing.  There are 4 sizes and for this we recommend the green cap which is 3.8mm or the yellow cap which is 2.4mm. Those are the middle sizes.  

If you are using a dip pen a medium size nib is a good place to start. 2-3mm Brause, a c1 or c2 Speedball, a #1-2 Mitchel or 2-3mm Tape.  

	

**Paper:**

Lots of options here.  I am a fan of the Strathmore sketch and drawing 300 series.  But there are a lot of good ones from Rodia, Canson and others. If you can talk to the people at the local art store they can probably help find something they have. For this you want blank sheets, nothing pre-lined or dotted. 

**Ink:**

Again, lots of options here.  If you go with the Parallel Pen, you may want to consider getting a bottle of fountain pen ink or walnut ink to refill them with.  The cartridges go fast but can be refilled with a small pipette or syringe.  You can also put ink straight into the barrel and forget about the cartridge.  Mine haven't leaked, yet. 

For dip pens walnut ink and sumi ink are some of the best.  India ink contains shellac and can make things difficult. 

####[Exercise 1 - Guidelines](https://i.imgur.com/E5Bvvv1.jpg)


The first thing to do is [line your paper](https://i.imgur.com/A3H3II2.jpg) or make some guide sheets.  [Guide Sheets](https://i.imgur.com/bsIvgEb.jpg)
 are used under the paper you are writing on.  [The have dark lines that are visible through the sheet you are writing on.](https://i.imgur.com/NQUzTom.jpg)

1.  [You can make a simple nib ladder on a small scrap of paper.](https://i.imgur.com/vMSqaxy.jpg) We will be doing the ascenders and descenders at 2 and the x-	height at 4. Also we need some space between the lines and we will do 2 for that.  

2.  [Use your pencil and the nib ladder to make little marks down the margin of the page, or both if you only have a ruler.](https://i.imgur.com/oeSfNLG.jpg)

3.  [Then use a ruler or t-square to draw the lines on your paper.](https://i.imgur.com/lTPghO1.jpg)  A sharp regular pencil works just fine or if you are making guide sheets an extra fine black marker.  [The t-square works great on a pad of paper.](https://i.imgur.com/2DBsUsI.jpg)

4.  [You now have a lined sheet of paper or if you made the guide sheet you can use small bits of tape to tape a fresh sheet of paper to it.](https://i.imgur.com/E5Bvvv1.jpg)

####[Exercise 2 - Parts of the letters](https://i.imgur.com/ATqCFJw.jpg)

[Now we will learn the basic strokes of the script, the parts of the letters.](https://i.imgur.com/ATqCFJw.jpg)

1.  [Find the correct angle.](https://imgur.com/SxVQE4X) Place the nib totally parallel to the x- height line and pull a stroke down to the base line.  This is  0 deg, it is the full size of the nib.  Next place the nib perpendicular to the x- height line and pull a stroke.  This is 90 deg and the thinest line you can make. Now try a few at 45 deg.  Lastly go a little shallower then that and find the 30 deg pen angle. Finish your line with these and try a few lines from the top of the ascender and down to the bottom of the descender.

2.  [Add the entry and exit serifs to your vertical strokes.](https://i.imgur.com/VHOF0Sc.jpg)

3. [Now we will add the top branch.](https://i.imgur.com/agwvetp.jpg) Do a line of them all connected and try to keep constant spacing between them.  [Have another look at this Foundational Minimum by u/ucawmanuscript](http://i.imgur.com/ZhegfK2.jpg).


4. [And the bottom branch.](https://i.imgur.com/ypOID4I.jpg)  Same as the last line but on the bottom this time.

5. [The crescent moon.](https://i.imgur.com/wF9W4i9.jpg)  Begin just below the x-height line (waistline) and pull half a circle.  The left/bottom side goes counter clockwise from about 11 to 5 and the top/right goes clockwise.

6.  [Circles!!](https://i.imgur.com/ykduDUk.jpg)
Are pretty much universally hard for everyone to learn, don‚Äôt get too frustrated by them :)

7. [Wedge serifs.](https://i.imgur.com/3kioBbz.jpg) Are common style of serif made with an extra little stroke. 

**Spend some time practicing these basic strokes until to start to feel comfortable with them. I know this may seem boring, but have a little faith. There is a reason and you won't regret it.**

####[Exercise 3 - Share your work](https://imgur.com/)

Take pictures of your work on the exercises and post them in here. 

**If you want to earn the flair, you have to share :P**

This is an important step, hiding from the community won't help you improve.  No one starts out good at this. The point of this project is not to show off how perfect you are, the point is to improve. Sharing you work can be a very difficult thing, especially for new comers. But I can promise you that it's worth it.  

Imgur.com is a great place to upload pictures to. You can copy links to the images and post them onto reddit.  The markdown links are used in here, they show text and not the link address.  They are done by [Putting the text in brackets like this]NOSPACEHERE(www and the link in parentheses.com)  

**Congratulations on completing week one!! This contained the most information that we need to cover and the following weeks will have less babbling by me but this was some important stuff that needed to be covered.**

##[**Our New Glossary**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/glossary)

Well, the start of it :)";"http://imgur.com/bttG3Uo

Ugh. This is embarrassing. I‚Äôve been doing brush calligraphy since February, but this is my first time with a broad pen. It‚Äôs hard to try to draw straight up and down versus on a slant, and I keep trying to use pressure for the thick and thins! I have a lot to learn and a lot of practicing in my future. http://imgur.com/gallery/pKf7t14

My practice. I got into calligraphy about 2-3 months ago. Haven't been working on it much lately since my daughters are back in school. Love the study session idea. Hopefully I'll be able to keep going and learning. I'm so excited and almost overlooked this post. This will give me a kick in the butt to actually start learning. Thank you! Am I too late to the party? Here is one of my attempts: [part 1](https://imgur.com/a/3hhoayY)  
I recently got a parallel pen and enjoy it a lot, thanks for organizing this course!  
(The bottom branches are giving me headaches, though) My first attempt. I am loving the parallel pens. I got ways to go, that‚Äôs for sure.

[foundational - first attempt](https://i.imgur.com/KrmOuW2.jpg)  Thank you for doing this. I always wanted to learn this script. https://imgur.com/a/y8zScyX

I would like to enter this competition Ay I never post here really so hello

Anyways here's [my attempt.](https://i.imgur.com/9fjcY8d.jpg) Already have some experience with foundational so I took the time to do some more experimental stuff by the end of it, but yeh [deleted] https://imgur.com/ruL99ba

I couldn't find a ruler so I used graph paper. It either feels like I'm adding too much to the serifs or not enough. My pen skips but that's probably just me not pushing down evenly. [Its only a flesh would](http://imgur.com/lhFUusJ)


First time using a dip pen...and a thick nib. Using whatever we have in the house for now. I think I need to find some unlined paper that doesn‚Äôt bleed. I‚Äôm not good at judging how much ink to put on the nib.


Criticism wanted!

 [week 1 practice!](https://imgur.com/a/2QtTnzA) 

I‚Äôm very new to all this, but I enjoy the heck out of it. 
The last exercise and the crescents were really difficult for me - I feel like I did okay with the M‚Äôs and the U‚Äôs though. 
I‚Äôll keep practicing this week, and hopefully in a few weeks time, I‚Äôll be able to show some awesome work!

I also realize I wrote on my lined paper - ?üò¨ so...  Here's an attempt by me. http://imgur.com/Nuc6vMT

It's hard to hold the pen correctly and get the whole thing in contact with the paper. Does that get easier? Thank you for putting this together!

&#x200B;

[Here is my attempt at week 1 exercise](https://i.imgur.com/7G65sNH.png) with a 3.8mm Pilot Parallel (minus wedge serifs, since I couldn't fit it on my lined page). Tried to get into calligraphy a while back but didn't have time to stick with it. Hoping to get back on the horse! Here's my [practice](http://imgur.com/gallery/eJXNBCX)

I had difficulty getting the ink to write consistently, at times it would be fine, other times barely any ink comes out even though I recently dipped the pen and did one stroke. I tried diluting the ink with water and I think that helped. I know what I need to work on- especially those wedged serifs!!

I ran out of space to have a whole line dedicated to wedged serifs and circles but I'm still practicing that out of the picture! 

Thanks for organizing this practice for all of us. It really helps me as a beginner in calligraphy! Well, now or never.
I've always had HORRIBLE handwriting.
So I decided I'll start with calligraphy.

[Attempt 10-9-18](https://imgur.com/zQK8HxC)

[Attempt 10-13-18](https://imgur.com/IE7hXBn) [Session 1](https://imgur.com/TftsMMC) 

Here are my basic strokes.   
I think they're ok for being a leftie that writes vertically.

Estimating the correct width is a bit difficult though. Hey guys! Just found this sub & these excellent study posts and that made my day!
I‚Äôm just a beginner currently practicing brush hand lettering but I would live to know more.
The only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is that I‚Äôm a lefty and seeing how the pen should be used at soecific angles makes me wonder. Do you hsve any tips for lefties?
Thanks a lot! [deleted] [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YXllXHB.jpg?1)
Circles are pretty hard. Decided to do a second page, then realized I missed the wedge serifs, so had to go back and cram those in: [https://imgur.com/a/C4FQ9JO](https://imgur.com/a/C4FQ9JO) http://imgur.com/gXy9e8v

Complete beginner here! Please tell me how bad it is and what I should practice more!

Thank you for this study lessons!  Thank you for the feedback!! I keep meaning to post the week 2 practice, but my December was also nutty.

Thanks again ?üôÇ [deleted] Calligraphy foundational 1 https://imgur.com/gallery/pSisYpw

Those crescents. Ugh. Hopefully they get better. [Practice practice](https://i.imgur.com/3vHIZt7.jpg) My Pilot Parallel Pen arrived in the mail yesterday - I am putting this here to signal my intent to take part, so I'll add my practice when I have had the chance to give it a go!  I would have done it yesterday but I wanted to take the time to learn how to clean and look after my new pens first =)

&#x200B;

Is it OK to just try with printer paper or will I need to get something more sophisticated...? Here‚Äôs my go at week 1!

[foundational week 1](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ts5io4n)  You did great!!  This is what everyones start looks like :)  

Yeah going from slanted to straight takes some getting used to.  You can always add some vertical lines to your guide sheets to help you keep everything straight. I did it for a long time and I always use them with slanted stuff or it's all over the place.  

 All of your page looks great to me, but your first set of crescents are totally perfect!!!  You're doing great!  I am glad you like it and I hope you can keep doing more as well. 

One thing I would work on is being a little rounder with the branches. You are kinda sliding to the side more then doing a sharper curve.  The branch part is a nice steady curve. Am I too late responding?  Sorry I don't know how I missed this one. And no there really isn't a too late for this, it's all going into the wiki so people can do it whenever they wan to. 

Looks like you are off to a good start with it. The spacing on the branching looks really even and a lot of those top ones look nice and round, couple of those **o**s look pretty good too. This is solid, nice work!  Welcome!  Sorry about the delay dec got crazy busy. The parallel pens are great. Yeah this stuff takes time and practice but it looks like you are off to a good start.  

I would focus on working on the curves. With the branching you are looking for a steady curve.  You are kinda sliding the pen over in a line, then doing a sharper curve.

The moons and circles are really hard but a few at the end of your line are starting to look nice.  With some of the left side crescent moons it looks like you are going a bit too far down and to the left before you start to curve to the right.  You can start curving to the right side sooner and it will be a bit rounder. 

Nice work keep going with it!   I dont think of it as a competition but rather, expanding your skills and understanding of letters.

Can you post a straight on picture so I can make a few comments on it. Noice! Hey, it's good to see ya here :)  Happy cake day!!! 

Can't help but skip to the letters eh :P haha  Those top branches look really nice and the middle ""o"" on the second line is very round, noice!  I think you are off to a great start!  ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20e74bm4v)  Practice is how you get better, I am happy you found it helpful.

I am a big fan of the black Noodler's ink for refilling the cartridges with. You get a big bottle for like $13 ands it will last you a while.  The study sessions will also get added to the wiki afterworlds so it will always be here. 

I think some of your branches are a bit close, mostly the bottom ones. You should leave a little more space inside them.  But you did a good job with it, I hope you get more ink soon :) Welcome! By any means :)

I think your serifs mostly look fine, little bigger or smaller isn't criminal, the important part is consistency.

I would work on being a little rounder with the branches.  It's tricky for everyone at first but you are looking for a nice steady curve.  You are kinda going over then doing a sharper curve. 

Learning to be even with the pen also takes a bit of practice but it will come. 
 Welcome!  It takes a little practice to get used to the dip pen. What paper and ink are you using?  

Based on what I see here you could be over dipping.  You can try not going so deep with it or lightly touching it to the edge of the ink well as you pull it out. Some people also like to give it a light flick but not too hard or you'll wind up with too little ink.

Once you start to get used to using the dip pen the writing will come easier.  Welcome!  You can always line more paper :)  I am really glad you enjoyed it.  This stuff is difficult for new people to learn, that's pretty normal. I would say put a date on this sheet and hold onto it.  You would be amazed at the difference after you spend some time practicing.  That steady curve on the crescents will come with time and practice.  The wedge serifs are a bit heavy, I would work on not pulling that second stroke down so far. Try to keep it tighter. Keep practicing these exercises and it will get easier.

You did great with the circles, nice work!

Yeah it will get easier.  People get used to pencils and ballpoint pens where the angle doesn't matter. Getting used to the broad nib that you have to keep flat will take a little time but you will learn.  I would work on going a bit rounder with the branches.  You are kinda going over then doing a real sharp curve.  You are looking for a nice steady curve all the way around.  But your spacing looks pretty consistent, nice work!  
 Welcome, thanks for doing it :)

Consistent practice can be hard to get into the swing of but if you can do it you can start to make a lot of progress. You did good with this thought, nice work! The serifs and the spacing on the branching parts are really consistent.   I would practice being a little rounder with the branching, steady curve with the stroke.   I hope I see more from you!  Thanks for doing it!

What pen and ink are you using?  The viscosity of the ink matters so a little bit of water can solve problems.

This looks really nice, the spacing in the branching parts is really consistent, the curves are pretty nice.  That second ""o"" on the bottom line looks really round.  Keep practicing and you'll be rocking it in no time :) Welcome, no better time then now :)

My handwriting is pretty terrible as well.  I think learning calligraphy can help to learn to write better.  If I treat my handwriting like I do calligraphy then I can do a lot better with it. 

I would practice the circles some more, they are hard but more practice there will help with the branching as well.   Woo!! This is great :) I think that 3rd sheet is looking better then the first one!  And there are some nice circles on the page. 

I would try and go a little more curved with the serifs.  So there is a little circle with the negative space. [Like on this *i*](https://i.imgur.com/9WFYIOU.jpg) More then ok, this is great :) I feel bad for you lefties, but you always seem to get it done. So is it harder to get the width because your hand is in the way?  

It looks like your spacing is pretty consistent. I think you could be a little rounder on a few of the top branches. But some of them look really nice and the bottom ones look really nice too.  Welcome! I think I already got this one somewhere else but I forgot that part haha.  You just popped in the discord too didn't you?  At least you found the party, that's the important part :)

Seems like you already know what you need to practice, It's a good sign you are paying attention to what you are doing :)  Definitely take you time with it, the more you get this part down the easier the next one will be and the better off you will be in the long run. I think your pen angle might be a little steep in some of this, looks closer to 45.

It's kinda tricky to keep the pen totally flat on the page as you pull the strokes. Lifting an edge seems to be a pretty common thing people have to learn to not do.  I tend to have a pretty tight grip and push kinda hard. To me it seemed like trying to be a bit more gentle with my grip helped that some but I don't know if that applies to you at all.  Haha yes they are. But they get easier over time. I would leave a bit more counter space, the space inside the letter, with the branching. Some of them look a little tight.  That last full size O looks really round!  Welcome! Haha they are a pretty common serif so it's good to learn them.  

It looks like you are doing well with the vertical strokes and the circles too! The branching looks a little tight, especially the top branches.  I would leave a little more counter space in there.  [This is an example of the **n** and it shows the counter space and the relation to the **o**](https://i.imgur.com/Swz23nx.jpg) Some of the spacing on the bottom branches looks really good. But over all try and focus on consistent spacing with the top and bottom branches.  Nice work, I hope this is helpful for you!  Welcome! It's not bad at all! 

The vertical strokes seem nice and parallel, the serifs look constant. The branching looks like it has a decent curve and the O's are soild.  I would focus on trying to be a bit more consistent with the spacing in the branching.  It's pretty good but there are a few spots that are a little narrow and a few that are wide. You can also work more on the O's, the point where the two moons connect on the bottom is hard.  Try to focus on where you are aiming as you pull the stroke on the right side not the tip of the stroke as it goes.  If that makes sense...

But this is great work!  Thanks for doing it :)  Welcome! I love that shimmer ink haha what is it?  

Looks like you are off to a good start.  With the branching yours is on the narrow end. Which is fine if you want a more narrow foundation, some people like to do it like that.  But you can go a little wider with it if you want.  [This example shows an ""n"" overlaid on on ""o"" so you can see the spacing in relation to the ""o"".](https://i.imgur.com/Swz23nx.jpg)   

The curve on the top branches is looking good but on the bottom ones you doing more of a slide to the side then a curve. That second one from the left on the line has a nice curve to it. 

Your ""o""s are looking better by the end of that line.  That 3rd one from the right looks nice!  

I can't really help you with the left handed part lol.  How are you writing?  Welcome! Haha yeah they are hard to get a feel for. Keep working on them and it gets easier. I would focus on practicing those and the O's.  It will help with the branching as well. They have the same curve to them. 

Also when you are doing you nib ladder be careful to keep them right next to each other so it stays consistent. 

Nice start I hope to see more! Beautiful!!! Printer paper might feather, but marker paper works great for me! I used tracing paper and it worked well
 Welcome! Haha I see some minimums in here, they're fun aren't they :)

So looks like you are starting some of the upper branches a bit low. If you compare the distance from where the branch hits to the stem with the bottom branches, there is a bigger gap on top.  A lot of them look like they have a nice curve to them but make sure you aren't sliding over first and then curving. Those O's look nice. [It's the same curve as with the branching.](https://imgur.com/Swz23nx)

Your spacing overall feels pretty consistent, nice work with that! You are drifting towards the narrow end of things, like on those minimums,  which is fine if thats your thing.  If you are starting on the next part of this and see those flash cards there is [this set of narrow ones also.](https://imgur.com/a/KQQabt2)

This is great work, I hope this is helpful for you!

 Thanks! I didn't feel my first crescents were that good, and the second set felt worse. Once I put them together though, I feel like I understood how they were supposed to be. Thanks for the advice. Thanks for the comments! By the way, I stumbled upon the source of your flash cards. They were created by Ann Hechle, so the connection to Edwards Johnston is pretty close: [https://twitter.com/Lett\_Arc/status/928390455225659392](https://twitter.com/Lett_Arc/status/928390455225659392)  

I would love to see the other study cards she made, but so far I couldn't find them. I failed at replying and I think I replied to the thread and not your comment. Thanks for the feedback. :) Uh oh. It has been placed in the trash already :/ [deleted] I‚Äôm using 80 gsm printer paper with Pelikan edelstein ink in mandarin.


 Thank you so much! I‚Äôm very excited for all this ^.^ Thanks for the information and the advice! I also have a question. Not that I'm looking for excuses, but are there scripts that have more angled branches? I am actually just wondering if I'm subconsciously trying to emulate something I've seen. Thanks again! Thanks for the feedback! I do notice that my branching isn't always as round as I'd like it. Will certainly keep practicing! Thanks! I think so too, I am not satisfied with the circles.
I'll keep practicing. Thanks :) I‚Äôll try tomorrow  Well i find it a bit difficult to estimate the width because i actually write vertically, so all my letters are on their side when i write them.
(does that make sense? like [this](https://i.imgur.com/cZAMA2d.jpg). I write my Textura Quadrata in the same way.) Ahah LOL yeah sorry, I thought that maybe a new post was more appropriate. ?üòÖ
And yes I did jus popped in to the discord, but I was a bit busy the last few days so I couldn‚Äôt check it out. Ohh I was thinking to make them equal to the width of the pen stroke, but I see what you mean now that they look tight. Thanks! [deleted] Thanks :) Thank You!!! Looks like there we 3 sets of them she made haha I am so happy to learn something about them.

Also this has gotten me to do some scanning I have been meaning to for a while now...

[Italic](https://imgur.com/a/tHtwGHl)

[Narrow Foundational](https://imgur.com/a/KQQabt2)

:) lol yup :P  learning is fun haha

Yeah, for sure.   [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/qPYDjbF.jpg)

I took the liberty of pre-judging your work in the competition, hope you don't mind. (also the image might be stretched or something, it looked straight enough in gimp) Welp you already lose the competition. Muahahaha. ?üòÇ  I still do that lol, get focused in one one thing and lose track of others.  But you practice and things come easier and you do it less.  The viscosity of the ink matters. The fountain pen inks can be a little bit thin for dip pen stuff sometimes and can cause trouble. If it keeps giving you problems you might want to look into some sumi or walnut.  Yeah there are. The Italic stuff is more angled and it's very popular so you could easily be thinking about that and subconsciously going that direction. 

Also doing the branches like that seems to be very common for people starting out with foundational. I think the curve just takes a little getting used to :)  Ohh I get it now, thanks! That's kinda cool but yeah I get how it can make it difficult for you. 
 For Sure! If you are doing a gothic script like texture then yeah making the space the width of the pen stroke is what you want to do.  But for foundational it's a bigger space. [Here is the **n** from foundational over the **o** to show the counter space you should be going for.](https://i.imgur.com/Swz23nx.jpg) Wow I still don't understand how they get so many colors in it but that ink is amazing.  

Yeah I think I get what you mean with the lefty stuff. I am glad it was helpful, Happy New Year!! Well, that's a pleasant surprise, you should make dedicated post so they won't get overlooked! Where did you get them from? Now I have to find somebody with a nicer printer than mine and a laminator... you've done it But I am the only participant I am trying to make a ladder with a India ink and various nibs (I couldn't find in my city quality paper, so I'm using paper for a printer), but when I try to write thick line I only get like 1,5mm.

Also is it normal that I can smear this line into 1x1cm rectangle? It seems like I should have a lot more ink than 60ml I got them is a big bag of ""calligraphy books and stuff"" I got off craigslist, really lucked out with that one. 

I was thinking about posting them but I know sometimes people have different views about sharing their teaching materials. I was wondering if I should email her and ask if it's ok to do now that I know who made them. I am a little confused by what you are asking, do you have a pic of it? ";48;https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/9kdr3i/study_sessions_foundational_part_1/;Calligraphy;"Study Sessions - Foundational - Part 1 ##Welcome 
&nbsp;

We have been getting a lot of questions about how to get started with calligraphy.  We did some study sessions on here are while back and we thought this would be worth a try. We chose Foundational for our first script because it's a great one for people to get started with.  It's set up in a way so you don't need any calligraphy experience to do it.  So if you already have some experience this first week will be recap stuff but it's important to cover. 

There are 4 parts, we will post 1 a week on Monday's.

Plus there is a prize!! Anyone who completes all the exercises will earn a special ""Foundational"" user flair.  

If you have any questions about anything as we go feel free to post them in here. 

&nbsp;

##**Foundational**

----

&nbsp;

##Part 1 - Getting Started

####Intro to Foundational

The Foundational script was created by Edward Johnson.  It was modified from English Carolingian into a more modern form.  It is widely considered to be one of the best scripts for beginners to start with.  

####Key Points

-It is mostly commonly done with an x-height of 4 or 4 ¬Ω.  With ascenders and descenders at 1 ¬Ω  or 2.  

-The pen angle is mostly at 30 deg but the diagonal stroke of the **v**, **w** and **x** are done at 45 deg.

[-The most important letters are **o** and **n**. The **o** is based on a circle and the **n** sets the arches and the counters. Foundational Minimum by u/ucawmanuscript](http://i.imgur.com/ZhegfK2.jpg)

####Pen, Paper and Ink

There are a lot of possibilities here. This is some general information about what you can use for this but if you already have some stuff you can probably use that.

**Pen:**

If you are brand new to Calligraphy the Pilot Parallel Pens are very useful tools.  For people new to this there can be a lot of different things to learn at once and it can be a bit overwhelming. This is a very easy to use tool that will simplify things and can help you focus on writing.  There are 4 sizes and for this we recommend the green cap which is 3.8mm or the yellow cap which is 2.4mm. Those are the middle sizes.  

If you are using a dip pen a medium size nib is a good place to start. 2-3mm Brause, a c1 or c2 Speedball, a #1-2 Mitchel or 2-3mm Tape.  

	

**Paper:**

Lots of options here.  I am a fan of the Strathmore sketch and drawing 300 series.  But there are a lot of good ones from Rodia, Canson and others. If you can talk to the people at the local art store they can probably help find something they have. For this you want blank sheets, nothing pre-lined or dotted. 

**Ink:**

Again, lots of options here.  If you go with the Parallel Pen, you may want to consider getting a bottle of fountain pen ink or walnut ink to refill them with.  The cartridges go fast but can be refilled with a small pipette or syringe.  You can also put ink straight into the barrel and forget about the cartridge.  Mine haven't leaked, yet. 

For dip pens walnut ink and sumi ink are some of the best.  India ink contains shellac and can make things difficult. 

####[Exercise 1 - Guidelines](https://i.imgur.com/E5Bvvv1.jpg)


The first thing to do is [line your paper](https://i.imgur.com/A3H3II2.jpg) or make some guide sheets.  [Guide Sheets](https://i.imgur.com/bsIvgEb.jpg)
 are used under the paper you are writing on.  [The have dark lines that are visible through the sheet you are writing on.](https://i.imgur.com/NQUzTom.jpg)

1.  [You can make a simple nib ladder on a small scrap of paper.](https://i.imgur.com/vMSqaxy.jpg) We will be doing the ascenders and descenders at 2 and the x-	height at 4. Also we need some space between the lines and we will do 2 for that.  

2.  [Use your pencil and the nib ladder to make little marks down the margin of the page, or both if you only have a ruler.](https://i.imgur.com/oeSfNLG.jpg)

3.  [Then use a ruler or t-square to draw the lines on your paper.](https://i.imgur.com/lTPghO1.jpg)  A sharp regular pencil works just fine or if you are making guide sheets an extra fine black marker.  [The t-square works great on a pad of paper.](https://i.imgur.com/2DBsUsI.jpg)

4.  [You now have a lined sheet of paper or if you made the guide sheet you can use small bits of tape to tape a fresh sheet of paper to it.](https://i.imgur.com/E5Bvvv1.jpg)

####[Exercise 2 - Parts of the letters](https://i.imgur.com/ATqCFJw.jpg)

[Now we will learn the basic strokes of the script, the parts of the letters.](https://i.imgur.com/ATqCFJw.jpg)

1.  [Find the correct angle.](https://imgur.com/SxVQE4X) Place the nib totally parallel to the x- height line and pull a stroke down to the base line.  This is  0 deg, it is the full size of the nib.  Next place the nib perpendicular to the x- height line and pull a stroke.  This is 90 deg and the thinest line you can make. Now try a few at 45 deg.  Lastly go a little shallower then that and find the 30 deg pen angle. Finish your line with these and try a few lines from the top of the ascender and down to the bottom of the descender.

2.  [Add the entry and exit serifs to your vertical strokes.](https://i.imgur.com/VHOF0Sc.jpg)

3. [Now we will add the top branch.](https://i.imgur.com/agwvetp.jpg) Do a line of them all connected and try to keep constant spacing between them.  [Have another look at this Foundational Minimum by u/ucawmanuscript](http://i.imgur.com/ZhegfK2.jpg).


4. [And the bottom branch.](https://i.imgur.com/ypOID4I.jpg)  Same as the last line but on the bottom this time.

5. [The crescent moon.](https://i.imgur.com/wF9W4i9.jpg)  Begin just below the x-height line (waistline) and pull half a circle.  The left/bottom side goes counter clockwise from about 11 to 5 and the top/right goes clockwise.

6.  [Circles!!](https://i.imgur.com/ykduDUk.jpg)
Are pretty much universally hard for everyone to learn, don‚Äôt get too frustrated by them :)

7. [Wedge serifs.](https://i.imgur.com/3kioBbz.jpg) Are common style of serif made with an extra little stroke. 

**Spend some time practicing these basic strokes until to start to feel comfortable with them. I know this may seem boring, but have a little faith. There is a reason and you won't regret it.**

####[Exercise 3 - Share your work](https://imgur.com/)

Take pictures of your work on the exercises and post them in here. 

**If you want to earn the flair, you have to share :P**

This is an important step, hiding from the community won't help you improve.  No one starts out good at this. The point of this project is not to show off how perfect you are, the point is to improve. Sharing you work can be a very difficult thing, especially for new comers. But I can promise you that it's worth it.  

Imgur.com is a great place to upload pictures to. You can copy links to the images and post them onto reddit.  The markdown links are used in here, they show text and not the link address.  They are done by [Putting the text in brackets like this]NOSPACEHERE(www and the link in parentheses.com)  

**Congratulations on completing week one!! This contained the most information that we need to cover and the following weeks will have less babbling by me but this was some important stuff that needed to be covered.**

##[**Our New Glossary**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/glossary)

Well, the start of it :) http://imgur.com/bttG3Uo

Ugh. This is embarrassing. I‚Äôve been doing brush calligraphy since February, but this is my first time with a broad pen. It‚Äôs hard to try to draw straight up and down versus on a slant, and I keep trying to use pressure for the thick and thins! I have a lot to learn and a lot of practicing in my future. http://imgur.com/gallery/pKf7t14

My practice. I got into calligraphy about 2-3 months ago. Haven't been working on it much lately since my daughters are back in school. Love the study session idea. Hopefully I'll be able to keep going and learning. I'm so excited and almost overlooked this post. This will give me a kick in the butt to actually start learning. Thank you! Am I too late to the party? Here is one of my attempts: [part 1](https://imgur.com/a/3hhoayY)  
I recently got a parallel pen and enjoy it a lot, thanks for organizing this course!  
(The bottom branches are giving me headaches, though) My first attempt. I am loving the parallel pens. I got ways to go, that‚Äôs for sure.

[foundational - first attempt](https://i.imgur.com/KrmOuW2.jpg)  Thank you for doing this. I always wanted to learn this script. https://imgur.com/a/y8zScyX

I would like to enter this competition Ay I never post here really so hello

Anyways here's [my attempt.](https://i.imgur.com/9fjcY8d.jpg) Already have some experience with foundational so I took the time to do some more experimental stuff by the end of it, but yeh [deleted] https://imgur.com/ruL99ba

I couldn't find a ruler so I used graph paper. It either feels like I'm adding too much to the serifs or not enough. My pen skips but that's probably just me not pushing down evenly. [Its only a flesh would](http://imgur.com/lhFUusJ)


First time using a dip pen...and a thick nib. Using whatever we have in the house for now. I think I need to find some unlined paper that doesn‚Äôt bleed. I‚Äôm not good at judging how much ink to put on the nib.


Criticism wanted!

 [week 1 practice!](https://imgur.com/a/2QtTnzA) 

I‚Äôm very new to all this, but I enjoy the heck out of it. 
The last exercise and the crescents were really difficult for me - I feel like I did okay with the M‚Äôs and the U‚Äôs though. 
I‚Äôll keep practicing this week, and hopefully in a few weeks time, I‚Äôll be able to show some awesome work!

I also realize I wrote on my lined paper - ?üò¨ so...  Here's an attempt by me. http://imgur.com/Nuc6vMT

It's hard to hold the pen correctly and get the whole thing in contact with the paper. Does that get easier? Thank you for putting this together!

&#x200B;

[Here is my attempt at week 1 exercise](https://i.imgur.com/7G65sNH.png) with a 3.8mm Pilot Parallel (minus wedge serifs, since I couldn't fit it on my lined page). Tried to get into calligraphy a while back but didn't have time to stick with it. Hoping to get back on the horse! Here's my [practice](http://imgur.com/gallery/eJXNBCX)

I had difficulty getting the ink to write consistently, at times it would be fine, other times barely any ink comes out even though I recently dipped the pen and did one stroke. I tried diluting the ink with water and I think that helped. I know what I need to work on- especially those wedged serifs!!

I ran out of space to have a whole line dedicated to wedged serifs and circles but I'm still practicing that out of the picture! 

Thanks for organizing this practice for all of us. It really helps me as a beginner in calligraphy! Well, now or never.
I've always had HORRIBLE handwriting.
So I decided I'll start with calligraphy.

http://imgur.com/gallery/pDK0VAW [Attempt 10-1-18](https://imgur.com/ZCEvdBe) 

[Attempt 10-9-18](https://imgur.com/zQK8HxC)

[Attempt 10-13-18](https://imgur.com/IE7hXBn) [Session 1](https://imgur.com/TftsMMC) 

Here are my basic strokes.   
I think they're ok for being a leftie that writes vertically.

Estimating the correct width is a bit difficult though. Hey guys! Just found this sub & these excellent study posts and that made my day!
I‚Äôm just a beginner currently practicing brush hand lettering but I would live to know more.
The only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is that I‚Äôm a lefty and seeing how the pen should be used at soecific angles makes me wonder. Do you hsve any tips for lefties?
Thanks a lot! [deleted] [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YXllXHB.jpg?1)
Circles are pretty hard. Decided to do a second page, then realized I missed the wedge serifs, so had to go back and cram those in: [https://imgur.com/a/C4FQ9JO](https://imgur.com/a/C4FQ9JO) http://imgur.com/gXy9e8v

Complete beginner here! Please tell me how bad it is and what I should practice more!

Thank you for this study lessons!  Thank you for the feedback!! I keep meaning to post the week 2 practice, but my December was also nutty.

Thanks again ?üôÇ [deleted] Calligraphy foundational 1 https://imgur.com/gallery/pSisYpw

Those crescents. Ugh. Hopefully they get better. [Practice practice](https://i.imgur.com/3vHIZt7.jpg) My Pilot Parallel Pen arrived in the mail yesterday - I am putting this here to signal my intent to take part, so I'll add my practice when I have had the chance to give it a go!  I would have done it yesterday but I wanted to take the time to learn how to clean and look after my new pens first =)

&#x200B;

Is it OK to just try with printer paper or will I need to get something more sophisticated...? Here‚Äôs my go at week 1!

[foundational week 1](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ts5io4n)  You did great!!  This is what everyones start looks like :)  

Yeah going from slanted to straight takes some getting used to.  You can always add some vertical lines to your guide sheets to help you keep everything straight. I did it for a long time and I always use them with slanted stuff or it's all over the place.  

 All of your page looks great to me, but your first set of crescents are totally perfect!!!  You're doing great!  I am glad you like it and I hope you can keep doing more as well. 

One thing I would work on is being a little rounder with the branches. You are kinda sliding to the side more then doing a sharper curve.  The branch part is a nice steady curve. Am I too late responding?  Sorry I don't know how I missed this one. And no there really isn't a too late for this, it's all going into the wiki so people can do it whenever they wan to. 

Looks like you are off to a good start with it. The spacing on the branching looks really even and a lot of those top ones look nice and round, couple of those **o**s look pretty good too. This is solid, nice work!  Welcome!  Sorry about the delay dec got crazy busy. The parallel pens are great. Yeah this stuff takes time and practice but it looks like you are off to a good start.  

I would focus on working on the curves. With the branching you are looking for a steady curve.  You are kinda sliding the pen over in a line, then doing a sharper curve.

The moons and circles are really hard but a few at the end of your line are starting to look nice.  With some of the left side crescent moons it looks like you are going a bit too far down and to the left before you start to curve to the right.  You can start curving to the right side sooner and it will be a bit rounder. 

Nice work keep going with it!   I dont think of it as a competition but rather, expanding your skills and understanding of letters.

Can you post a straight on picture so I can make a few comments on it. Noice! Hey, it's good to see ya here :)  Happy cake day!!! 

Can't help but skip to the letters eh :P haha  Those top branches look really nice and the middle ""o"" on the second line is very round, noice!  I think you are off to a great start!  ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20e74bm4v)  Practice is how you get better, I am happy you found it helpful.

I am a big fan of the black Noodler's ink for refilling the cartridges with. You get a big bottle for like $13 ands it will last you a while.  The study sessions will also get added to the wiki afterworlds so it will always be here. 

I think some of your branches are a bit close, mostly the bottom ones. You should leave a little more space inside them.  But you did a good job with it, I hope you get more ink soon :) Welcome! By any means :)

I think your serifs mostly look fine, little bigger or smaller isn't criminal, the important part is consistency.

I would work on being a little rounder with the branches.  It's tricky for everyone at first but you are looking for a nice steady curve.  You are kinda going over then doing a sharper curve. 

Learning to be even with the pen also takes a bit of practice but it will come. 
 Welcome!  It takes a little practice to get used to the dip pen. What paper and ink are you using?  

Based on what I see here you could be over dipping.  You can try not going so deep with it or lightly touching it to the edge of the ink well as you pull it out. Some people also like to give it a light flick but not too hard or you'll wind up with too little ink.

Once you start to get used to using the dip pen the writing will come easier.  Welcome!  You can always line more paper :)  I am really glad you enjoyed it.  This stuff is difficult for new people to learn, that's pretty normal. I would say put a date on this sheet and hold onto it.  You would be amazed at the difference after you spend some time practicing.  That steady curve on the crescents will come with time and practice.  The wedge serifs are a bit heavy, I would work on not pulling that second stroke down so far. Try to keep it tighter. Keep practicing these exercises and it will get easier.

You did great with the circles, nice work!

Yeah it will get easier.  People get used to pencils and ballpoint pens where the angle doesn't matter. Getting used to the broad nib that you have to keep flat will take a little time but you will learn.  I would work on going a bit rounder with the branches.  You are kinda going over then doing a real sharp curve.  You are looking for a nice steady curve all the way around.  But your spacing looks pretty consistent, nice work!  
 Welcome, thanks for doing it :)

Consistent practice can be hard to get into the swing of but if you can do it you can start to make a lot of progress. You did good with this thought, nice work! The serifs and the spacing on the branching parts are really consistent.   I would practice being a little rounder with the branching, steady curve with the stroke.   I hope I see more from you!  Thanks for doing it!

What pen and ink are you using?  The viscosity of the ink matters so a little bit of water can solve problems.

This looks really nice, the spacing in the branching parts is really consistent, the curves are pretty nice.  That second ""o"" on the bottom line looks really round.  Keep practicing and you'll be rocking it in no time :) Welcome, no better time then now :)

My handwriting is pretty terrible as well.  I think learning calligraphy can help to learn to write better.  If I treat my handwriting like I do calligraphy then I can do a lot better with it. 

I would practice the circles some more, they are hard but more practice there will help with the branching as well.   Woo!! This is great :) I think that 3rd sheet is looking better then the first one!  And there are some nice circles on the page. 

I would try and go a little more curved with the serifs.  So there is a little circle with the negative space. [Like on this *i*](https://i.imgur.com/9WFYIOU.jpg) More then ok, this is great :) I feel bad for you lefties, but you always seem to get it done. So is it harder to get the width because your hand is in the way?  

It looks like your spacing is pretty consistent. I think you could be a little rounder on a few of the top branches. But some of them look really nice and the bottom ones look really nice too.  Welcome! I think I already got this one somewhere else but I forgot that part haha.  You just popped in the discord too didn't you?  At least you found the party, that's the important part :)

Seems like you already know what you need to practice, It's a good sign you are paying attention to what you are doing :)  Definitely take you time with it, the more you get this part down the easier the next one will be and the better off you will be in the long run. I think your pen angle might be a little steep in some of this, looks closer to 45.

It's kinda tricky to keep the pen totally flat on the page as you pull the strokes. Lifting an edge seems to be a pretty common thing people have to learn to not do.  I tend to have a pretty tight grip and push kinda hard. To me it seemed like trying to be a bit more gentle with my grip helped that some but I don't know if that applies to you at all.  Haha yes they are. But they get easier over time. I would leave a bit more counter space, the space inside the letter, with the branching. Some of them look a little tight.  That last full size O looks really round!  Welcome! Haha they are a pretty common serif so it's good to learn them.  

It looks like you are doing well with the vertical strokes and the circles too! The branching looks a little tight, especially the top branches.  I would leave a little more counter space in there.  [This is an example of the **n** and it shows the counter space and the relation to the **o**](https://i.imgur.com/Swz23nx.jpg) Some of the spacing on the bottom branches looks really good. But over all try and focus on consistent spacing with the top and bottom branches.  Nice work, I hope this is helpful for you!  Welcome! It's not bad at all! 

The vertical strokes seem nice and parallel, the serifs look constant. The branching looks like it has a decent curve and the O's are soild.  I would focus on trying to be a bit more consistent with the spacing in the branching.  It's pretty good but there are a few spots that are a little narrow and a few that are wide. You can also work more on the O's, the point where the two moons connect on the bottom is hard.  Try to focus on where you are aiming as you pull the stroke on the right side not the tip of the stroke as it goes.  If that makes sense...

But this is great work!  Thanks for doing it :)  Welcome! I love that shimmer ink haha what is it?  

Looks like you are off to a good start.  With the branching yours is on the narrow end. Which is fine if you want a more narrow foundation, some people like to do it like that.  But you can go a little wider with it if you want.  [This example shows an ""n"" overlaid on on ""o"" so you can see the spacing in relation to the ""o"".](https://i.imgur.com/Swz23nx.jpg)   

The curve on the top branches is looking good but on the bottom ones you doing more of a slide to the side then a curve. That second one from the left on the line has a nice curve to it. 

Your ""o""s are looking better by the end of that line.  That 3rd one from the right looks nice!  

I can't really help you with the left handed part lol.  How are you writing?  Welcome! Haha yeah they are hard to get a feel for. Keep working on them and it gets easier. I would focus on practicing those and the O's.  It will help with the branching as well. They have the same curve to them. 

Also when you are doing you nib ladder be careful to keep them right next to each other so it stays consistent. 

Nice start I hope to see more! Beautiful!!! Printer paper might feather, but marker paper works great for me! I used tracing paper and it worked well
 Welcome! Haha I see some minimums in here, they're fun aren't they :)

So looks like you are starting some of the upper branches a bit low. If you compare the distance from where the branch hits to the stem with the bottom branches, there is a bigger gap on top.  A lot of them look like they have a nice curve to them but make sure you aren't sliding over first and then curving. Those O's look nice. [It's the same curve as with the branching.](https://imgur.com/Swz23nx)

Your spacing overall feels pretty consistent, nice work with that! You are drifting towards the narrow end of things, like on those minimums,  which is fine if thats your thing.  If you are starting on the next part of this and see those flash cards there is [this set of narrow ones also.](https://imgur.com/a/KQQabt2)

This is great work, I hope this is helpful for you!

 Thanks! I didn't feel my first crescents were that good, and the second set felt worse. Once I put them together though, I feel like I understood how they were supposed to be. Thanks for the advice. Thanks for the comments! By the way, I stumbled upon the source of your flash cards. They were created by Ann Hechle, so the connection to Edwards Johnston is pretty close: [https://twitter.com/Lett\_Arc/status/928390455225659392](https://twitter.com/Lett_Arc/status/928390455225659392)  

I would love to see the other study cards she made, but so far I couldn't find them. I failed at replying and I think I replied to the thread and not your comment. Thanks for the feedback. :) Uh oh. It has been placed in the trash already :/ [deleted] I‚Äôm using 80 gsm printer paper with Pelikan edelstein ink in mandarin.


 Thank you so much! I‚Äôm very excited for all this ^.^ Thanks for the information and the advice! I also have a question. Not that I'm looking for excuses, but are there scripts that have more angled branches? I am actually just wondering if I'm subconsciously trying to emulate something I've seen. Thanks again! Thanks for the feedback! I do notice that my branching isn't always as round as I'd like it. Will certainly keep practicing! Thanks! I think so too, I am not satisfied with the circles.
I'll keep practicing. Thanks :) I‚Äôll try tomorrow  Well i find it a bit difficult to estimate the width because i actually write vertically, so all my letters are on their side when i write them.
(does that make sense? like [this](https://i.imgur.com/cZAMA2d.jpg). I write my Textura Quadrata in the same way.) Ahah LOL yeah sorry, I thought that maybe a new post was more appropriate. ?üòÖ
And yes I did jus popped in to the discord, but I was a bit busy the last few days so I couldn‚Äôt check it out. Ohh I was thinking to make them equal to the width of the pen stroke, but I see what you mean now that they look tight. Thanks! [deleted] Thanks :) Thank You!!! Looks like there we 3 sets of them she made haha I am so happy to learn something about them.

Also this has gotten me to do some scanning I have been meaning to for a while now...

:) lol yup :P  learning is fun haha

Yeah, for sure.   [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/qPYDjbF.jpg)

I took the liberty of pre-judging your work in the competition, hope you don't mind. (also the image might be stretched or something, it looked straight enough in gimp) Welp you already lose the competition. Muahahaha. ?üòÇ  I still do that lol, get focused in one one thing and lose track of others.  But you practice and things come easier and you do it less.  The viscosity of the ink matters. The fountain pen inks can be a little bit thin for dip pen stuff sometimes and can cause trouble. If it keeps giving you problems you might want to look into some sumi or walnut.  Yeah there are. The Italic stuff is more angled and it's very popular so you could easily be thinking about that and subconsciously going that direction. 

Also doing the branches like that seems to be very common for people starting out with foundational. I think the curve just takes a little getting used to :)  Ohh I get it now, thanks! That's kinda cool but yeah I get how it can make it difficult for you. 
 For Sure! If you are doing a gothic script like texture then yeah making the space the width of the pen stroke is what you want to do.  But for foundational it's a bigger space. [Here is the **n** from foundational over the **o** to show the counter space you should be going for.](https://i.imgur.com/Swz23nx.jpg) Wow I still don't understand how they get so many colors in it but that ink is amazing.  

Yeah I think I get what you mean with the lefty stuff. I am glad it was helpful, Happy New Year!! Well, that's a pleasant surprise, you should make dedicated post so they won't get overlooked! Where did you get them from? Now I have to find somebody with a nicer printer than mine and a laminator... you've done it But I am the only participant I am trying to make a ladder with a India ink and various nibs (I couldn't find in my city quality paper, so I'm using paper for a printer), but when I try to write thick line I only get like 1,5mm.

Also is it normal that I can smear this line into 1x1cm rectangle? It seems like I should have a lot more ink than 60ml I got them is a big bag of ""calligraphy books and stuff"" I got off craigslist, really lucked out with that one. 

I was thinking about posting them but I know sometimes people have different views about sharing their teaching materials. I was wondering if I should email her and ask if it's ok to do now that I know who made them. I am a little confused by what you are asking, do you have a pic of it? ";;

Starter cartridge pens for Engrossers/Copperplate;"I want to start learning Engrossers / Copperpoint calligraphy. I've read that the Nikko G is a good nib to start with, but don't know what to attach it to.

I understand there is a ""holder"" and people regularly dip their nibs into a pot of ink. I'm used to using the pilot parallel, which has cartridges. It seems a lot more straightforward and ""plug and play"". Is there something like this for pointed pen? (I hope I'm using that term properly!)";"Ackerman Pens and Osprey Pens both sell reasonably-priced fountain pens with Zebra G nib units, although the Ackerman pens are eyedropper or piston fillers. Another option would be the Fountain Pen Revolution pens with their ultraflex steel nibs; these give plenty of line variation but are tipped, so might not write as finely as you might like. Yet another would be the BlueDew flex pens - can't tell you what they're like as I've never tried one, but they do look promising. Finally, if you're happy with hunting on ebay then classic Osmiroid pens are available with Copperplate nibs; not as flexible as a G dip nib but easier to get working properly and far less troubled by corrosion.  
  
Of these I'd probably recommend the Osprey Pens and Fountain Pen Revolution offerings as the best balance of price, performance, and ease of getting things to work, but don't overlook the simple nib and holder - especially if you add a slip-on reservoir to save you having to dip annoyingly often. There are specialty flexible nibs for fountain pens but I think they are usually a bit expensive. 

As far as a cheap pointed pen equivalent to the pilot parallel, I've never seen anything like that. 

If you want something that is convenient to take with you anywhere, just for practice purposes, a soft pencil such as a 6B, a large ballpoint pen (about 0.9 or larger) or stiff brush pens are all very capable of creating nice Copperplate or Engrosser's. It's just that the pen holds is quite different. But if you're just practicing letter forms it works great. I reccomend that you use a pointed (dip) pen for engrissers script and copperplate. It is very affordable to do so and I have seen other people on this sub mention that it is very difficult to get the same amount of flex with a fountain pen as you can get with a nib (though I personally have no experience with fountain pens). 

Getting started, I would reccomend the Hunt 101 nib, an oblique nib holder, some walnut ink (Tom Nortons, or crystals if you want to mix it yourself), and some paper (HP 32 lb premium is a good quality practice paper. It's what I practice on). You can get started for very cheap with these supplies. Good luck! Thank you so much for these! I'll look into each of these.  


I see a lot of nibs recommended on Amazon, but sold as ""comic pens"" [https://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Comic-Model-Chrome-PG-6B-C-K/dp/B006CQW428/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=1RASWYGYSEB71&keywords=zebra%2Bg%2Bnib&qid=1704355294&sprefix=zebra%2Bg%2Bnib%2Caps%2C90&sr=8-1&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Comic-Model-Chrome-PG-6B-C-K/dp/B006CQW428/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1RASWYGYSEB71&keywords=zebra%2Bg%2Bnib&qid=1704355294&sprefix=zebra%2Bg%2Bnib%2Caps%2C90&sr=8-1&th=1)  


Are these the same nibs everyone is talking about, or is this some kind of ""comic-oriented variant"" better suited to drawing vs writing? Are there any specific flexible nibs (and the fountain pen to attach it to) you'd suggest for writing in Engrosser's? G nibs (Any brand) are interchangeably called comic nibs, they're what you want as G nibs are fairly universally considered the most forgiving entry point into pointed-pen calligraphy.

As for the original question, the reason there are very few ""plug and play"" pointed nib options like the pilot parallel for broad nib is due to their nature. The tip of a pilot parallel is very resilient, unless you're using it a *lot*, that tip will remain serviceable for a very long time.

Pointed nibs must come to a very fine point, and for good line variation must also flex a fair amount. So you're putting stress and friction on a very thin bit of metal when you write with it. The result of that is that  you need to replace pointed nibs frequently as they become scratchy and incabaple of producing good hairlines or no longer provide a consistent line.

 Replacing a nib on a dip holder is the work of a few seconds, replacing a nib that must be fully aligned on a feed and may or may not require disassembling a pen is a lot more hassle to be doing all the time I still haven't bought a flex nib for my fountain pens, so perhaps someone else here will have suggestions but just now while I was looking for recommendations I found this [video](https://youtu.be/g5gz2vcQZPQ?si=psR8goLpvo-1yOyG) showing how to get a pointed pen nib into a cheap fountain pen.   Might try it myself. Thanks for this post, I don't think I would have found that video otherwise =) That makes sense, thanks for the explanation!  


Someone else said there was cartridge-fed fountain pens with flexible nibs, but they were ""tipped"". I've seen nibs where the tips are slightly rounded (almost like a ballpoint pen), I assume so it doesn't catch on paper when writing. Is this was ""tipped"" means? I could see how this won't produce as fine a line as a sharp point. Very interesting, saved this for the future! 

I just ordered a fountain pen revolution with flex nib, as well as an oblique holder with Nikko G's. Will be interesting to compare these! Yes that's exactly what tipped means - if you look at regular fountain pens they'll usually have the tip material listed seperately from the nib. You'll see iridium on older nibs and things like tungsten and rhenium on more modern ones.

This is partly to reduce snagging, but mostly for longevity reasons. The tip will always be made from a more durable metal than the nib body. 

The flex nib fountain pens try to strike a middle ground, and they do it fairly well! As you deduced, they won't make a very fine hairline but do get enough variation to give your handwriting a bit of flair if that's what you're after, but you're never going to be able to reproduce things like Zanerian engrossers script or Ornamental penmanship well.";5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/18y6ph0/starter_cartridge_pens_for_engrosserscopperplate/;Calligraphy;"Starter cartridge pens for Engrossers/Copperplate I want to start learning Engrossers / Copperpoint calligraphy.

What kind of pen is this?;;"I'm not sure of the pen, but it's definitely a fude nib Not sure about the pen brand but the nib looks like a fude nib. Quite a few brands have these nibs available.

A ballpoint isn‚Äôt as nice to write with as a fountain pen, a fountain pen isn‚Äôt as nice to write with as a brush, so if you want this effect, just use a brush. Fude nib Hero has a Parker51 copy. Looks pretty similar. It sort of looks like a vanishing point with a fude nib. is it just a matter of personal preference, or is there something objectively wrong with them? there‚Äôs a lot of other posts on different subreddits saying they love to use these kinds of nibs They‚Äôre more convenient in the sense that you get constant ink flow and never have to dip like a brush. For western-style modern cursive calligraphy, with its extremely long flowing lines, a fude nib is probably better. If you‚Äôre writing Chinese characters with frequent breaks for different strokes you‚Äôll get a more pleasing effect from a real brush. Well said. Also, for a lot of strokes (Êíá„ÄÅÊç∫„ÄÅÈâ§ for example), it just feels nasty, scratchy, raspy. I suppose it can produce a better effect for those strokes than a typical fountain pen nib, but I‚Äôd much rather use a brush. How much does the type of paper you‚Äôre using contribute to this scratchy feeling you‚Äôre talking about? my guess is it‚Äôs not a paper issue, but rather the relative flexibility of a nib versus actual brush bristles. a brush is an intensely delicate tool, whereas a nib has to be stiffer in order to retain the right ‚Äúbrush-like‚Äù shape. a brush can bend freely and come back to a point, but a nib with that softness would become unusable almost immediately.

so certain kinds of changes in direction using a fude nib are just stiff in an unpleasant way by comparison to a brush. Thanks again to u/ewhetstone for answering so well in my absence. Yes, that‚Äôs just the thing. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt mislead, because I am no expert!

Fudenosuke Trilogy Brush pen set of Tombow - possibilities and experiences with brush calligraphy;"Hi, I got fude de mannen of Pilot, the more expensive version of fude fountain pen made by Pilot, I have lots of inks gifted from lot of family members for Christmas, and today visited uncle and got this set of Tombow, after unpacking the tips feel very sturdy 2x brush pen and one with a hard nib, its some kind of set, would love to ask more about fude pens and brushes and find out about possibilities of use not only in art, but mainly in calligraphy, though I used dip pen most of the time, still beginner and need to figure out or kinda create my own style. 

Would love to see some good youtubers that often use fude pens or brushes in their work and inspire from them, I can certainly try from imagination, but to know, how, what, technique is allways a better way for me, I like to be well informed on tools I do use, what their good for and what is not recommended using such brush/pen for.

I would like some social network if there is such for brush calligraphy, something really specific for it, not just a subreddit, because the r/BrushCalligraphy is pretty dead, I never received answear there and mostly there is 1-5 people online, not populated forum, if I can join something interesting via Tapatalk or any other social network, Im very very eager to do so and discuss there, as its I think at least quiet specific and not possible to just ask random people, its better to be at place where artist actually use it, work with the tools and have experience and knowledge about brands quality etc, that is in short what Im looking for, or in short...:-) it was quiet longer post, but its harder for me to express myself in English, to find certain words so sometimes I write stuff around and trying to explain different way when I dont know the word, rather than using some online translators, practice is allways good I guess, and I beleave what I described is understandable to certain point.

Study Sessions - Uncial - Part 1 - Getting Started;"###Welcome!

To the Uncial Study Session.  If you saw the Foundational one a lot of this will be familiar. That's because I kinda copy/pasted a framework for these. They will be going into the wiki so that anyone can do them at any point in the future if they want.  [If you didn't see the foundational one it can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/studysessions#wiki_foundational)


It's set up in a way so you don't need any calligraphy experience to do it. If you already have some experience this first week will be recap stuff but it's important to cover.

There are 4 parts, we will post 1 a week on Thursdays, starting Nov. 1st.

Plus there is a prize!! Anyone who completes all the exercises will earn a special ""Uncial"" user flair.

If you have any questions about anything as we go feel free to post them in here. 


----

&nbsp;

##Part 1 - Getting Started

####Intro to Uncial

Uncial is an old script. It originated around the 2nd century^1. It was a more practical script because it was faster to write then the Roman Capitals or the Rustic script. That lead to it being the predominant book hand.  Many variations of uncial emerged over time and it was commonly used until around the 10th century^2. [I found this on wikipedia and it shows some evolution of scripts](https://i.imgur.com/nJSvKKc.png)

####Glossary

If you have any questions about any of the terms we have a [Glossary in our wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/glossary)


####Key Points

- The pen angle is usually 20¬∞ - 30¬∞

- The x-height is usually 4 pen widths 

- The ascenders and descenders are usually 1 pen width

- The **O** is based on a circle

- Uncial is a majuscule only script, it does not have minuscules. 

####Getting Started - Pen, Paper and Ink

There are a lot of possibilities here. This is some general information about what you can use for this but there are many different options.  If you already have something you can try this what what you have. 

**Pen:**

If you are brand new to Calligraphy the Pilot Parallel Pens are very useful tools.  For people new to this there can be a lot of different things to learn at once and it can be a bit overwhelming. This is a very easy to use tool that will simplify things and can help you focus on writing.  There are 4 sizes and for this I recommend the green cap which is 3.8mm or the yellow cap which is 2.4mm. Those are the middle sizes.  

If you are using a dip pen a medium size nib is a good place to start. 2-3mm Brause, a c1 or c2 Speedball, a #1-2 Mitchel or 2-3mm Tape.  

	

**Paper:**

Lots of options here.  I am a fan of the Strathmore sketch and drawing 300 series.  But there are a lot of good ones from Rodia, Canson and others. If you can talk to the people at the art store and they can help find something they have. For this you want blank sheets, nothing pre-lined or dotted. 

**Ink:**

Again, lots of options here.  If you go with the Parallel Pen, you may want to consider getting a bottle of fountain pen ink or walnut ink to refill them with.  The cartridges go fast but can be refilled with a small pipette or syringe.  You can also put ink straight into the barrel and forget about the cartridge.  Mine haven't leaked, yet. 

For dip pens walnut ink and sumi ink are some of the best.  India ink contains shellac and can make things difficult. 

This work in the pictures for this was done on 9x12 Swarthmore 300 sketch paper with walnut ink in a 3.8 Pilot Parallel Pen.  

####[Exercise 1 - Guidelines and Guide Sheets](https://i.imgur.com/uu915gX.jpg)


The first thing to do is [line your paper](https://i.imgur.com/LSpycQi.jpg) or make some guide sheets.  [Guide Sheets](https://i.imgur.com/bsIvgEb.jpg)
 are used under the paper you are writing on.  [The have dark lines that are visible through the sheet you are writing on.](https://i.imgur.com/NQUzTom.jpg)

1.  [You can make a simple nib ladder on a small scrap of paper.](https://i.imgur.com/aVkwn4m.jpg) We will be doing the ascenders and descenders at 1 and the x-height at 4. We also need some space between the lines and we will do 1 for that.  

2.  [Use your pencil and the nib ladder to make little marks down the margin of the page, or both if you only have a ruler.](https://i.imgur.com/oeSfNLG.jpg)

3.  [Then use a ruler or t-square to draw the lines on your paper.](https://i.imgur.com/lTPghO1.jpg)  A sharp regular pencil works just fine or if you are making guide sheets an extra fine black marker.  The t-square works great on a pad of paper.

4.  [You now have a lined sheet of paper or if you made the guide sheet you can use small bits of tape to tape a fresh sheet of paper to it.](https://i.imgur.com/E5Bvvv1.jpg)

####[Exercise 2 - Parts of the letters](https://i.imgur.com/ebdc4e8.jpg)

Now we will learn the basic strokes of the script, the parts of the letters.

1.  [Find the correct angle.](https://i.imgur.com/Q03nTGF.jpg) Place the nib totally parallel to the x-height line and pull a stroke down to the base line.  This is  0¬∞, it is the full width of the nib.  Next place the nib perpendicular to the x-height line and pull a stroke.  This is 90¬∞ and the thinest line you can make. Now try a few at 45¬∞.  Now go a little shallower then that and find the correct 30¬∞ pen angle. Lastly try doing a few crosses,  The cross stroke should be noticeably thinner then the vertical stroke. 

2.  [Add the entry serif.](https://i.imgur.com/BVVAyNM.jpg) Start slightly lower and to the left.  Do a subtle curve into the main stroke.  Pull the stroke to the baseline and stop.  Not all of the vertical strokes will end with an exit serif.  

3. [Entry and exit serif.](https://i.imgur.com/muhH35L.jpg) Start the same as the last one but this time do a subtle curve to the right and up to end the stroke.  Some of the vertical strokes will end with an exit serif. 

4. [The diagonal stroke.](https://i.imgur.com/OycyHZB.jpg) Holding the pen at a steeper angle, around 40¬∞, start slightly below the waist line.  Pull the pen up and to the right and do a subtle curve then pull the diagonal stroke to the baseline the do a subtle curve up and out. This is the stroke that will be used with the **X**, **V**, **A** and **N**.   

5. [The crescent moon.](https://i.imgur.com/nvQmtRu.jpg) The bottom left side of the **O**. Pull the stroke down and slightly to the left then curve it around to the right.  This is an important stroke in uncial it is used in letters like **O**, **C**, **E**, **D**, **Q**. Consistency with this stroke is important.  

6. [The other side of the moon.](https://i.imgur.com/DMIcNbO.jpg) The top right side of the **O**, the opposite of the last exercise. 

7. [The O.](https://i.imgur.com/Y6XTeaS.jpg) Combine the 2 crescent moons into 1 O.  It should be circular and not an oval. 

8. [Middle stroke of the s.](https://i.imgur.com/tYKX5nx.jpg)  Starting with a tight curve to the left and down. The middle of the stroke goes across at a shallow angel and ends with another tight curve back to the left.  

Spend some time practicing these basic strokes until to start to feel comfortable with them. I know this may seem boring, but have a little faith. There is a reason and you won't regret it.

####[Exercise 3 - Share your work](https://imgur.com/)

Take pictures of your work on the exercises and post them in here.

**If you want to earn the flair, you have to share :P**

This is an important step, hiding from the community won't help you improve.  No one starts out good at this. The point of this project is not to show off how perfect you are, the point is to improve. Sharing you work can be a very difficult thing, especially for new comers. But I can promise you that it's worth it.  

[Imgur.com is a great place to upload pictures to.](https://imgur.com/) You can copy links to the images and post them onto reddit.  The markdown links are used in here, they show text and not the link address.  They are down by [Putting the text in brackets like this]NOSPACEHERE(www and the link in parentheses.com)

Congratulations on completing week one!! This contained the most information that we need to cover and the following weeks will have less babbling by me but this was some important stuff that needed to be covered. If you have any questions or any interesting info about the history of uncial please feel free to post in here :)";"[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lqNAc4N.jpg?1) 

First time doing something so structured. I'm a huge fan of this new studies thing! I'm very beginner, so sometimes you can see the ink isn't always flowing from my pen and I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly there. https://imgur.com/HGsTKt0 Excited to finally break in my pilot parallel! [https://imgur.com/gallery/JcYRInV](https://imgur.com/gallery/JcYRInV)  All I have at the moment is a marker and printer paper but I tried
http://imgur.com/gallery/9VgBba2 [I tried it too! ](http://i.imgur.com/4qBuTjj.jpg)

I am very new to this, but I cannot wait to learn more about calligraphy! I am working in a leuchtturm 1917, so I do have dots, bu I am ignoring them and have been following the guidelines in a sheet behind my paper. 
I am using a manuscript calligraphy fountain pen with a 4B nib. 

Any feedback would be appreciated!  I think i did well with Foundational, and really enjoyed it.

Here's my first session with Uncial.

[https://imgur.com/a/8WqqrvX](https://imgur.com/a/8WqqrvX) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gy8LIjp.jpg)

I'm pretty new to calligraphy in general, but even more so with the uncial script.  I'm glad this guide was posted!  Any criticism is welcomed, feel free to give me some tips.

Done with two pilot parallel pens, with the 1.5mm and 3.8mm nibs. [The study sessions wiki page can be here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/studysessions) [Here is my attempt!](https://imgur.com/a/KedpIPU) :)

I struggled with the crescents, but it was easier to put them together when drawing the O's. On the diagonal strokes, is there a guideline for how far right the stroke should go when pulling it down?

Feedback is appreciated! [deleted] Thanks for putting these together!

I'm having some trouble wrapping my head around how that N is supposed to be formed. Any thoughts/pointers? 

Here's my row of N's: https://imgur.com/md7opsm

And then some N's in context of a phrase: https://imgur.com/g4QbKaV Welcome! I am glad you like them :) What kind of pen and ink are you using? Parallel Pen?  Done some Uncial before? :P haha
You like doing your middle of the **s** steep don't you. 
 Welcome! [Happy Cake Day!!](https://i.imgur.com/gglZBF9.gifv) New pens are fun, is it your first one?

Looks like you are off to a good start. Your pen angle looks good and the verticals look nice. Looks like you are keeping the nib nice and flat on the page.  There are a couple of spots on the diagonals where it looks like its leaning to the left side of the nib a bit.  That creates those uneven jagged strokes.  I would say to focus in the circles, uncial is a really round script so it will help with a lot down the road. Nice work! 

 Welcome! Marker and printer paper is just fine for this, the important part is trying :) And it looks great, really consistent. I would practice the moons and the circles. Make sure you bring the right side ones all the way down to the baseline. Uncial has a lot of round in it so it will help down the road. 
Nice work!  Welcome! I have never actually used one of those manuscript calligraphy fountain pens, do you like them? 

For feedback I can give you a few things.  Out of curiosity have you done much cursive or italic before this? 

With the vertical strokes try to make sure they are straight up and down and don't have any slant to them. You can always add some vertical guidelines to your guide sheet to help with that. With the moons, some of them look more oval then circle.  With the first set you can start to curve to the right sooner. It's just a little bit of left and down at the start of the stroke and then a slow steady curve to the right. And if you think about it like a clock you should be going from about 11 to about 5. And you can always use a compass and add some circles to you guide sheets to help with that. 

I hope that's helpful for you and this is nice work over all!  I am glad you liked it and you did great with it! Some of it will carry over to this but some of it will be different.  The circles are the same :)  and this set of them looks better then the first set with the foundational so it looks like you have been making some progress. The vertical and the diagonals look great.  I would work on pulling the middle of the s a little more consistently.  They get smoother towards the end of the line but the get a bit skinnier. The s in uncial fits the o like in foundational.  But the s and the o seem to be some of the hardest parts for most people so don't sweat it too much.  Keep practicing like you have been and I am sure you will be crushing it in no time.  ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20e950ag4)  Welcome! All the stuff under the study flair is assumed to be for constructive criticism, it's about learning. That's a big x-height for the little pen! Varying the x-height is actually gonna be a part of this one later on, shhh don't tell anyone. 

For CC I would say that the pen angle looks a little steep on it. I would try to flatten it out a little, that will widen the vertical strokes a bit and the strokes going across will be narrower.  The vertical strokes are all looking really nice, straight up and down and the spacing is consistent.  And those circles are pretty good too! With the diagonals I would focus on making sure they are all touching the guidelines at the very top and bottom points on them.  The s stroke one with the little pen is a bit small, they should be the same width as the o and don't let them get too short.  

But overall It looks like you are off to a great start with this! I hope this is helpful for you :) The crescents are tricky and I kinda think they are easier when you are doing the O's too.  But looks like you did well with those O's! A lot of the in there are really nice and round.   With some of those first crescent ones it looks like you are going a little bit too far down and to the left before you curve to the right. Makes them a little ovalish. 

That's a good question.  There is some variety to what angle people do them at.  Some people like to do them a bit wider and some people do them skinnier. From what I can tell they are usually done a little steeper the 45¬∞, like 55¬∞ish (not the pen angle but the angle of the stroke.)  But they seem to range from about 45¬∞ to 60¬∞.  But I wouldn't do them wider then the O. That very last one on your line of them there is about as wide as I would do them but consistency is key. 

Overall this looks really solid, nice work!   ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20ea26xb6)  We would love to do as many of these as we can.  But we might need to recruit some help for some of them.  I just really started working on pointed stuff this summer and I am not sure I could pull one off.  We are planning a Gothic next month and a brush one after that. We will see how things shape up over the next few months. 

This one looks nice :)  That last circle on the line looks perfect! If you compare it to some of the others you can see with the crescent moon on the left side you start to curve it to the right a bit sooner.  Some of the other ones go down a bit more first and that makes them look more ovalish.  So don't let the stroke go too far down before you curve it to the right.  With the middle of the S stroke don't let it come up as you go across.  A little bit down is fine or straight across but if it goes up it adds a little bump in there.  

Nice work!  I hope we can get a pointed pen going at some point in the future.  Thats about where your supposed to be going.  A lot of the time the verticals will get done with a higher pen angle so they are thinner.  The diagonal stroke is the same as for the A and X.   What specifically is giving you trouble?  Yup! The 3.8mm parallel for this one with sepia ink. Haha, I think I may have made them steeper than usual for this. But I just usually try to keep the top part a lot smaller than the bottom, in all scripts. I know a lot of people don't like it, but I do. Even when the top and bottom are equal size, it looks upside down to me.  Nope, not my first fountain pen! I just haven‚Äôt really sat down with this one for any length of time yet. It‚Äôs been a challenge getting used to it because it writes so wet and I‚Äôm left handed, but I‚Äôm happy with it so far. I think I might also need to redo my guide sheet as the guides near the O taper in toward the end of the page. Thank you for your feedback, I‚Äôll definitely be practicing more! Thanks, I figured market and printer paper would be an easy way to get into this before I invest heavily in something I know nothing about. I think I'm using too much wrist and not enough arm, might be throwing my curves off but could be affecting my straight lines more, having some trouble with those too. Thank you so much for the feedback, I'll try to practice it with this extra info :) 

I have been practicing Italic before, a lot actually but I never use it. Also my 'normal' handwriting is always kind of cursive. I learned that in school and I just stuck to it I guess :) 

I like the fountain pen a lot! I have not used many other materials for calligraphy before, only markers, so I don't have much to compare it with but in my opinion this works very well. The only downside is that when you switch cardridges or you run out of ink, it will take a while for the ink to get to the nib again, which can be a bit frustrating at times, but overall it's working perfectly for me!   Thanks for the suggestions. I agree with the s being an issue. And thanks for doing these! I think I am/was being thrown off by two things: where the vertical strokes start, and the thickness. Are they on the inside or outside of the curved bits? And the thickness of them was bothering me too. I'll try with a higher pen angle and see how I like it. Thank you so much for your response! I also realized I posted this in the wrong lesson comments ?ü§¶?üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's good to clean out the nib on those from time to time. They come with the little plastic film rectangle thingy (or use paper) and you can slide that between the plates of the nib to clean out any dried ink that can interfere with the ink flow.  Or you can slide the whole nib out and wash it.  Little warm water or some glass cleaner, nothing harsh needed. 

But looking at you page I think your issue is coming from not keeping the nib totally flat on the page.  People get used to pencils and ballpoint pens where they don't need to be perpendicular to the page and they will still write just fine.  But with a broad nib if you lean at all the edge of the nib will come off the page and you won't get clean strokes.  So if you notice it happening pause and look at how the nib is sitting on the page, you might need to slightly re-adjust your hand position so the pen is perpendicular to the page.  Yeah I noticed that! I mean I feel like as long as things are done consistently there is a lot of room to play with the letters. I like how the **s** looks with the little top. If everyone developed identical hands it would be kinda boring.  Yeah those love to smear haha, I feel bad for you lefties. I wonder if walnut ink would be less smearable, it dries really fast. I wasn't sure if you were doing the smaller o's on purpose or not, a new guide sheet is a good plan :) Yeah I hope it's helpful for you, that's great!   I made a second attempt at it, I think it came out a little bit better this time http://imgur.com/a/rsreybK That makes sense to me. I think by the time the marker runs out of ink you will know whether or not you wanna keep going with it. Parallel Pen is like $10-12, bottle of walnut ink or Noodler's ink $10-12.50 pad of paper $10. It would be a solid upgrade from the marker printer paper and not a huge investment. 

Now imgur won't let me see your page again, silly imgur. I think it's good to  move your arm and not do everything with your wrist.  I think it helps a ton pulling straight lines, especially long ones. Go slow with them and try to focus on the point you are aiming for with the stroke more then the tip of the nib as it goes across the paper.  If you want you can use a compass to make some circles on guide sheets, it can help a lot with your arm learning to pull the curve.  
 I was asking because this looks a bit like italic, so I was thinking you had done some.  Italic has the slant and ovals, uncial is vertical and has circles. But I bet if you went looking around you could probably find someone doing some kind of italic uncial stuff.

Cool, thanks! I gotta keep my eye out for one of those pens and give them a try sometime.  Do you think I can get a picture of how you hold your pen when you write? I'm having a hard time imagining how I should be holding the pen in a way that isn't somewhat uncomfortable/difficult to control my writing. ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20e8zd32u)  I'm still trying to figure imgur out, I had stuff public then got weird comments so I had to put stuff on hidden I dont know if that's the problem.

The compass sounds like a great idea, I think my natural handwriting is small, slanted, narrow and messy so this is like learning how to write all over again [I guess it's the same as how I hold any pen.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d2/Hold-a-Pen-Step-3.jpg/aid10174323-v4-900px-Hold-a-Pen-Step-3.jpg)  I found that online but that's how I hold it.  But there are other ways. How do you hold a normal pen?


But you have to hold it perpendicular to the page so [the edge of the nib sits flat on the page.](https://i.imgur.com/RTICWVu.jpg)  This was the line it writes will be nice and solid.  [If you lean to the side the edge of the nib will lift off the page.](https://i.imgur.com/WpaJCPp.jpg)  This will cause the pen to write [those jagged lines](https://i.imgur.com/fEX3d3Y.jpg).

To the Uncial Study Session.  If you saw the Foundational one a lot of this will be familiar. That's because I kinda copy/pasted a framework for these. They will be going into the wiki so that anyone can do them at any point in the future if they want.  [If you didn't see the foundational one it can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/studysessions#wiki_foundational)


It's set up in a way so you don't need any calligraphy experience to do it. If you already have some experience this first week will be recap stuff but it's important to cover.

There are 4 parts, we will post 1 a week on Thursdays, starting Nov. 1st.

Plus there is a prize!! Anyone who completes all the exercises will earn a special ""Uncial"" user flair.

If you have any questions about anything as we go feel free to post them in here.

##Part 1 - Getting Started

####Intro to Uncial

Uncial is an old script. It originated around the 2nd century^1. It was a more practical script because it was faster to write then the Roman Capitals or the Rustic script. That lead to it being the predominant book hand.  Many variations of uncial emerged over time and it was commonly used until around the 10th century^2. [I found this on wikipedia and it shows some evolution of scripts](https://i.imgur.com/nJSvKKc.png)

####Glossary

If you have any questions about any of the terms we have a [Glossary in our wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/glossary)


####Key Points

- The pen angle is usually 20¬∞ - 30¬∞

- The x-height is usually 4 pen widths 

- The ascenders and descenders are usually 1 pen width

- The **O** is based on a circle

- Uncial is a majuscule only script, it does not have minuscules. 

####Getting Started - Pen, Paper and Ink

There are a lot of possibilities here. This is some general information about what you can use for this but there are many different options.  If you already have something you can try this what what you have. 

**Pen:**

If you are brand new to Calligraphy the Pilot Parallel Pens are very useful tools.  For people new to this there can be a lot of different things to learn at once and it can be a bit overwhelming. This is a very easy to use tool that will simplify things and can help you focus on writing.  There are 4 sizes and for this I recommend the green cap which is 3.8mm or the yellow cap which is 2.4mm. Those are the middle sizes.  

If you are using a dip pen a medium size nib is a good place to start. 2-3mm Brause, a c1 or c2 Speedball, a #1-2 Mitchel or 2-3mm Tape.  

	

**Paper:**

Lots of options here.  I am a fan of the Strathmore sketch and drawing 300 series.  But there are a lot of good ones from Rodia, Canson and others. If you can talk to the people at the art store and they can help find something they have. For this you want blank sheets, nothing pre-lined or dotted. 

**Ink:**

Again, lots of options here.  If you go with the Parallel Pen, you may want to consider getting a bottle of fountain pen ink or walnut ink to refill them with.  The cartridges go fast but can be refilled with a small pipette or syringe.  You can also put ink straight into the barrel and forget about the cartridge.  Mine haven't leaked, yet. 

For dip pens walnut ink and sumi ink are some of the best.  India ink contains shellac and can make things difficult. 

This work in the pictures for this was done on 9x12 Swarthmore 300 sketch paper with walnut ink in a 3.8 Pilot Parallel Pen.  

####[Exercise 1 - Guidelines and Guide Sheets](https://i.imgur.com/uu915gX.jpg)


The first thing to do is [line your paper](https://i.imgur.com/LSpycQi.jpg) or make some guide sheets.  [Guide Sheets](https://i.imgur.com/bsIvgEb.jpg)
 are used under the paper you are writing on.  [The have dark lines that are visible through the sheet you are writing on.](https://i.imgur.com/NQUzTom.jpg)

1.  [You can make a simple nib ladder on a small scrap of paper.](https://i.imgur.com/aVkwn4m.jpg) We will be doing the ascenders and descenders at 1 and the x-height at 4. We also need some space between the lines and we will do 1 for that.  

2.  [Use your pencil and the nib ladder to make little marks down the margin of the page, or both if you only have a ruler.](https://i.imgur.com/oeSfNLG.jpg)

3.  [Then use a ruler or t-square to draw the lines on your paper.](https://i.imgur.com/lTPghO1.jpg)  A sharp regular pencil works just fine or if you are making guide sheets an extra fine black marker.  The t-square works great on a pad of paper.

4.  [You now have a lined sheet of paper or if you made the guide sheet you can use small bits of tape to tape a fresh sheet of paper to it.](https://i.imgur.com/E5Bvvv1.jpg)

####[Exercise 2 - Parts of the letters](https://i.imgur.com/ebdc4e8.jpg)

Now we will learn the basic strokes of the script, the parts of the letters.

1.  [Find the correct angle.](https://i.imgur.com/Q03nTGF.jpg) Place the nib totally parallel to the x-height line and pull a stroke down to the base line.  This is  0¬∞, it is the full width of the nib.  Next place the nib perpendicular to the x-height line and pull a stroke.  This is 90¬∞ and the thinest line you can make. Now try a few at 45¬∞.  Now go a little shallower then that and find the correct 30¬∞ pen angle. Lastly try doing a few crosses,  The cross stroke should be noticeably thinner then the vertical stroke. 

2.  [Add the entry serif.](https://i.imgur.com/BVVAyNM.jpg) Start slightly lower and to the left.  Do a subtle curve into the main stroke.  Pull the stroke to the baseline and stop.  Not all of the vertical strokes will end with an exit serif.  

3. [Entry and exit serif.](https://i.imgur.com/muhH35L.jpg) Start the same as the last one but this time do a subtle curve to the right and up to end the stroke.  Some of the vertical strokes will end with an exit serif. 

4. [The diagonal stroke.](https://i.imgur.com/OycyHZB.jpg) Holding the pen at a steeper angle, around 40¬∞, start slightly below the waist line.  Pull the pen up and to the right and do a subtle curve then pull the diagonal stroke to the baseline the do a subtle curve up and out. This is the stroke that will be used with the **X**, **V**, **A** and **N**.   

5. [The crescent moon.](https://i.imgur.com/nvQmtRu.jpg) The bottom left side of the **O**. Pull the stroke down and slightly to the left then curve it around to the right.  This is an important stroke in uncial it is used in letters like **O**, **C**, **E**, **D**, **Q**. Consistency with this stroke is important.  

6. [The other side of the moon.](https://i.imgur.com/DMIcNbO.jpg) The top right side of the **O**, the opposite of the last exercise. 

7. [The O.](https://i.imgur.com/Y6XTeaS.jpg) Combine the 2 crescent moons into 1 O.  It should be circular and not an oval. 

8. [Middle stroke of the s.](https://i.imgur.com/tYKX5nx.jpg)  Starting with a tight curve to the left and down. The middle of the stroke goes across at a shallow angel and ends with another tight curve back to the left.  

Spend some time practicing these basic strokes until to start to feel comfortable with them. I know this may seem boring, but have a little faith. There is a reason and you won't regret it.

####[Exercise 3 - Share your work](https://imgur.com/)

Take pictures of your work on the exercises and post them in here.

**If you want to earn the flair, you have to share :P**

This is an important step, hiding from the community won't help you improve.  No one starts out good at this. The point of this project is not to show off how perfect you are, the point is to improve. Sharing you work can be a very difficult thing, especially for new comers. But I can promise you that it's worth it.  

[Imgur.com is a great place to upload pictures to.](https://imgur.com/) You can copy links to the images and post them onto reddit.  The markdown links are used in here, they show text and not the link address.  They are down by [Putting the text in brackets like this]NOSPACEHERE(www and the link in parentheses.com)

Congratulations on completing week one!! This contained the most information that we need to cover and the following weeks will have less babbling by me but this was some important stuff that needed to be covered. If you have any questions or any interesting info about the history of uncial please feel free to post in here :) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lqNAc4N.jpg?1) 

First time doing something so structured. I'm a huge fan of this new studies thing! I'm very beginner, so sometimes you can see the ink isn't always flowing from my pen and I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly there. https://imgur.com/HGsTKt0 Excited to finally break in my pilot parallel! [https://imgur.com/gallery/JcYRInV](https://imgur.com/gallery/JcYRInV)  All I have at the moment is a marker and printer paper but I tried
http://imgur.com/gallery/9VgBba2 [I tried it too! ](http://i.imgur.com/4qBuTjj.jpg)

I am very new to this, but I cannot wait to learn more about calligraphy! I am working in a leuchtturm 1917, so I do have dots, bu I am ignoring them and have been following the guidelines in a sheet behind my paper. 
I am using a manuscript calligraphy fountain pen with a 4B nib. 

Any feedback would be appreciated!  I think i did well with Foundational, and really enjoyed it.

Here's my first session with Uncial.

[https://imgur.com/a/8WqqrvX](https://imgur.com/a/8WqqrvX) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gy8LIjp.jpg)

I'm pretty new to calligraphy in general, but even more so with the uncial script.  I'm glad this guide was posted!  Any criticism is welcomed, feel free to give me some tips.

Done with two pilot parallel pens, with the 1.5mm and 3.8mm nibs. [The study sessions wiki page can be here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/studysessions) [Here is my attempt!](https://imgur.com/a/KedpIPU) :)

I struggled with the crescents, but it was easier to put them together when drawing the O's. On the diagonal strokes, is there a guideline for how far right the stroke should go when pulling it down?

Feedback is appreciated! [deleted] Thanks for putting these together!

I'm having some trouble wrapping my head around how that N is supposed to be formed. Any thoughts/pointers? 

Here's my row of N's: https://imgur.com/md7opsm

And then some N's in context of a phrase: https://imgur.com/g4QbKaV Welcome! I am glad you like them :) What kind of pen and ink are you using? Parallel Pen?  Done some Uncial before? :P haha
You like doing your middle of the **s** steep don't you. 
 Welcome! [Happy Cake Day!!](https://i.imgur.com/gglZBF9.gifv) New pens are fun, is it your first one?

Looks like you are off to a good start. Your pen angle looks good and the verticals look nice. Looks like you are keeping the nib nice and flat on the page.  There are a couple of spots on the diagonals where it looks like its leaning to the left side of the nib a bit.  That creates those uneven jagged strokes.  I would say to focus in the circles, uncial is a really round script so it will help with a lot down the road. Nice work! 

 Welcome! Marker and printer paper is just fine for this, the important part is trying :) And it looks great, really consistent. I would practice the moons and the circles. Make sure you bring the right side ones all the way down to the baseline. Uncial has a lot of round in it so it will help down the road. 
Nice work!  Welcome! I have never actually used one of those manuscript calligraphy fountain pens, do you like them? 

For feedback I can give you a few things.  Out of curiosity have you done much cursive or italic before this? 

With the vertical strokes try to make sure they are straight up and down and don't have any slant to them. You can always add some vertical guidelines to your guide sheet to help with that. With the moons, some of them look more oval then circle.  With the first set you can start to curve to the right sooner. It's just a little bit of left and down at the start of the stroke and then a slow steady curve to the right. And if you think about it like a clock you should be going from about 11 to about 5. And you can always use a compass and add some circles to you guide sheets to help with that. 

I hope that's helpful for you and this is nice work over all!  I am glad you liked it and you did great with it! Some of it will carry over to this but some of it will be different.  The circles are the same :)  and this set of them looks better then the first set with the foundational so it looks like you have been making some progress. The vertical and the diagonals look great.  I would work on pulling the middle of the s a little more consistently.  They get smoother towards the end of the line but the get a bit skinnier. The s in uncial fits the o like in foundational.  But the s and the o seem to be some of the hardest parts for most people so don't sweat it too much.  Keep practicing like you have been and I am sure you will be crushing it in no time.  ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20e950ag4)  Welcome! All the stuff under the study flair is assumed to be for constructive criticism, it's about learning. That's a big x-height for the little pen! Varying the x-height is actually gonna be a part of this one later on, shhh don't tell anyone. 

For CC I would say that the pen angle looks a little steep on it. I would try to flatten it out a little, that will widen the vertical strokes a bit and the strokes going across will be narrower.  The vertical strokes are all looking really nice, straight up and down and the spacing is consistent.  And those circles are pretty good too! With the diagonals I would focus on making sure they are all touching the guidelines at the very top and bottom points on them.  The s stroke one with the little pen is a bit small, they should be the same width as the o and don't let them get too short.  

But overall It looks like you are off to a great start with this! I hope this is helpful for you :) The crescents are tricky and I kinda think they are easier when you are doing the O's too.  But looks like you did well with those O's! A lot of the in there are really nice and round.   With some of those first crescent ones it looks like you are going a little bit too far down and to the left before you curve to the right. Makes them a little ovalish. 

That's a good question.  There is some variety to what angle people do them at.  Some people like to do them a bit wider and some people do them skinnier. From what I can tell they are usually done a little steeper the 45¬∞, like 55¬∞ish (not the pen angle but the angle of the stroke.)  But they seem to range from about 45¬∞ to 60¬∞.  But I wouldn't do them wider then the O. That very last one on your line of them there is about as wide as I would do them but consistency is key. 

Overall this looks really solid, nice work!   ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=ignoreme&message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&subject=delet%20this&message=delet%20this%20ea26xb6)  We would love to do as many of these as we can.  But we might need to recruit some help for some of them.  I just really started working on pointed stuff this summer and I am not sure I could pull one off.  We are planning a Gothic next month and a brush one after that. We will see how things shape up over the next few months. 

This one looks nice :)  That last circle on the line looks perfect! If you compare it to some of the others you can see with the crescent moon on the left side you start to curve it to the right a bit sooner.  Some of the other ones go down a bit more first and that makes them look more ovalish.  So don't let the stroke go too far down before you curve it to the right.  With the middle of the S stroke don't let it come up as you go across.  A little bit down is fine or straight across but if it goes up it adds a little bump in there.  

Nice work!  I hope we can get a pointed pen going at some point in the future.  Thats about where your supposed to be going.  A lot of the time the verticals will get done with a higher pen angle so they are thinner.  The diagonal stroke is the same as for the A and X.   What specifically is giving you trouble?  Yup! The 3.8mm parallel for this one with sepia ink. Haha, I think I may have made them steeper than usual for this. But I just usually try to keep the top part a lot smaller than the bottom, in all scripts. I know a lot of people don't like it, but I do. Even when the top and bottom are equal size, it looks upside down to me.  Nope, not my first fountain pen! I just haven‚Äôt really sat down with this one for any length of time yet. It‚Äôs been a challenge getting used to it because it writes so wet and I‚Äôm left handed, but I‚Äôm happy with it so far. I think I might also need to redo my guide sheet as the guides near the O taper in toward the end of the page. Thank you for your feedback, I‚Äôll definitely be practicing more! Thanks, I figured market and printer paper would be an easy way to get into this before I invest heavily in something I know nothing about. I think I'm using too much wrist and not enough arm, might be throwing my curves off but could be affecting my straight lines more, having some trouble with those too. Thank you so much for the feedback, I'll try to practice it with this extra info :) 

I have been practicing Italic before, a lot actually but I never use it. Also my 'normal' handwriting is always kind of cursive. I learned that in school and I just stuck to it I guess :) 

I like the fountain pen a lot! I have not used many other materials for calligraphy before, only markers, so I don't have much to compare it with but in my opinion this works very well. The only downside is that when you switch cardridges or you run out of ink, it will take a while for the ink to get to the nib again, which can be a bit frustrating at times, but overall it's working perfectly for me!   Thanks for the suggestions. I agree with the s being an issue. And thanks for doing these! I think I am/was being thrown off by two things: where the vertical strokes start, and the thickness. Are they on the inside or outside of the curved bits? And the thickness of them was bothering me too. I'll try with a higher pen angle and see how I like it. Thank you so much for your response! I also realized I posted this in the wrong lesson comments ?ü§¶?üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's good to clean out the nib on those from time to time. They come with the little plastic film rectangle thingy (or use paper) and you can slide that between the plates of the nib to clean out any dried ink that can interfere with the ink flow.  Or you can slide the whole nib out and wash it.  Little warm water or some glass cleaner, nothing harsh needed. 

But looking at you page I think your issue is coming from not keeping the nib totally flat on the page.  People get used to pencils and ballpoint pens where they don't need to be perpendicular to the page and they will still write just fine.  But with a broad nib if you lean at all the edge of the nib will come off the page and you won't get clean strokes.  So if you notice it happening pause and look at how the nib is sitting on the page, you might need to slightly re-adjust your hand position so the pen is perpendicular to the page.  Yeah I noticed that! I mean I feel like as long as things are done consistently there is a lot of room to play with the letters. I like how the **s** looks with the little top. If everyone developed identical hands it would be kinda boring.  Yeah those love to smear haha, I feel bad for you lefties. I wonder if walnut ink would be less smearable, it dries really fast. I wasn't sure if you were doing the smaller o's on purpose or not, a new guide sheet is a good plan :) Yeah I hope it's helpful for you, that's great!   I made a second attempt at it, I think it came out a little bit better this time http://imgur.com/a/rsreybK That makes sense to me. I think by the time the marker runs out of ink you will know whether or not you wanna keep going with it. Parallel Pen is like $10-12, bottle of walnut ink or Noodler's ink $10-12.50 pad of paper $10. It would be a solid upgrade from the marker printer paper and not a huge investment. 

Now imgur won't let me see your page again, silly imgur. I think it's good to  move your arm and not do everything with your wrist.  I think it helps a ton pulling straight lines, especially long ones. Go slow with them and try to focus on the point you are aiming for with the stroke more then the tip of the nib as it goes across the paper.  If you want you can use a compass to make some circles on guide sheets, it can help a lot with your arm learning to pull the curve.  
 I was asking because this looks a bit like italic, so I was thinking you had done some.  Italic has the slant and ovals, uncial is vertical and has circles. But I bet if you went looking around you could probably find someone doing some kind of italic uncial stuff.

Cool, thanks! I gotta keep my eye out for one of those pens and give them a try sometime.  Do you think I can get a picture of how you hold your pen when you write? I'm having a hard time imagining how I should be holding the pen in a way that isn't somewhat uncomfortable/difficult to control my writing. ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

If other people have other tutorials, or tips whether hand specific or generic, feel free to share them or PM me and I‚Äôll incorporate them! I‚Äôve messaged a few of you about any examples you would like to provide. As you send them to me, I‚Äôll edit them in. If I sent you a message, I won‚Äôt have incorporated any actual pieces from your history until you give me express permission. Also if I messaged you and you do not want to provide something, please respond so I can make suitable arrangements. Some guides have been added though.  See the disclaimer.

Since I don‚Äôt know how to do the fancy stuff I‚Äôm going to do the old fashioned way of indexing. Use CTRL-F [XXX] to find what you need!

I originally intended for this to be shorter, but it‚Äôs turning into quite a beast.

**[A] Step by Step Guide to Getting Started**

**[A.1] Welcome!**

Hi there! Welcome to our little corner of reddit and to the art of calligraphy! 

This post is I‚Äôm-interested-where-do-I-start guide. I‚Äôm trying to make a easier and more accessible guide for new people. For a more extensive introduction and explanation, please see the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/index) on the sidebar!

Disclaimer: I am not endorsed by any brand that I mention, although I wish that I was! Also if I linked to your image/work/site/comment/quote and you don‚Äôt want me to, let me know and I‚Äôll remove it!
Second disclaimer: I, like the intended reader of this, am relatively new to the craft and entirely self taught with no formal training. Thus, do not take my word as law please :) The people linked in the resources are much better than I.

It‚Äôs pretty easy to get started, and cheap too! Here we go :)



**[A.2] The Basics**

Calligraphy is the art of beautiful handwriting! Essentially, we learn a ‚Äúscript,‚Äù or a alphabet with a specific style. The materials are simple: paper, pencil, ruler, ink and a pen!

Let‚Äôs start with some basic terminology. I‚Äôll be explaining most of the terms as we go along, but to begin with, we need to know what a nib and a holder are. These are the two parts that constitute a ‚Äúdip pen.‚Äù 

[Nib](http://imgur.com/C2s4NpQ): The writing part of the pen, or the part that touches the paper, transferring the ink to the paper.

There are two types of nibs, [broad](http://imgur.com/9YjpSJZ) or [pointed](http://imgur.com/O9AAzni). This determines what kind of script you learn. These are two different beasts, so after we look at some examples, decide which one you want to learn first!

[Holders](http://imgur.com/CkZV9nm): This is what you stick the nib into! Broad edge nibs go in a straight holder, and pointed pen nibs go in an oblique holder, unless you‚Äôre a lefty. 


**[A.3] Let‚Äôs Talk about Scripts!**

Now that we got that over with, let‚Äôs talk about scripts! [See: [C.1] MISC Fonts Vs Scripts] There are two major groups of scripts, broad-edge and pointed pen, based on the kind of nib used. Let‚Äôs take a look at some examples of different scripts and see which one you want to learn. 

Broad-edge produces work like [Italic](http://imgur.com/ppUm9Cm), [Uncial](http://i.imgur.com/wvpNipI.jpg), [Bastard Secretary](http://i.imgur.com/tm8BJ79h.jpg) and [Fraktur](http://i.imgur.com/rgdscsi.jpg). We suggest beginning your journey with **Italic or Foundational**, as they‚Äôre less complex and teach the basics well. Remember, you can always learn more scripts later!

(You‚Äôll have to deal with my shoddy examples until people respond with their lovely work!)

The most common Pointed Pen scripts are [Spencerian](http://www.iampeth.com/lessons/spencerian/Real_pen_work/real_penwork_page12.html), [Ornamental Penmanship](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/Zaner_certificate.jpg), Copperplate, and [Engrossers](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/slides/Unknown%200004.jpg). They‚Äôre all different, you can pick which one to start with, although usually there is a progression from Spencerian to Ornamental Penmanship.

Please see the resources at the end of this guide for more in-depth comments on these scripts! Also, check out our [lovely imgur album](http://calligraphyalaphbets.imgur.com) for examples of various scripts. 



**[A.4] Supplies**

I‚Äôve Picked My Script- What Now?

Now that you‚Äôve picked your script, it‚Äôs time to buy some supplies! You really only need three things: paper, ink and a pen! 

A note on this section- this is intended to be as minimalist as possible. There are a wide range of nibs, inks and holders not included for sake of simplicity. A few sites where these are available are at the end.


**The Pen:**

**Broad-edge**: I suggest starting with a cartridge pen, rather than a nib+holder combination. [These](http://cdn.dickblick.com/items/208/81/20881-group3ww-l.jpg) come with non-removable nibs and ink cartridges, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about filling it up. It‚Äôs a lot easier to not have to deal with ink when you‚Äôre first starting out! They‚Äôre very easy to use :) If you buy a cartridge pen, you don‚Äôt need to buy bottled ink separately, although I would buy a pack a refills (they come with a few cartridges, but you‚Äôll eventually have to buy some refills so it may be smart to do it in the same order) [See [B.2] FAQs: What‚Äôs the difference between cartridge pens, fountain pens and dip pens?]

Recommended: The Pilot Parallels 3.8mm(green) or 6.0mm (blue)

I‚Äôm Broke: [Schaeffer Pen](http://www.fendrihan.com/images/SHE73402_Sheaffer_Calligraphy_Broad_FP_green2.jpg) (This is what I started with) or the [Manuscript Pen] (http://www.scribblers.co.uk/acatalog/manuscript_classic_calligraphy_5_set.jpg) Note: You shouldn‚Äôt have to order this online- I was able to find them at my Office Max/Hobby Lobby. These are alright to start out with, but really only marginally cheaper than ordering a Pilot Parallel.

I Don‚Äôt Want to Use a Cartridge Pen: [Buy a set](http://www.scribewritingessentials.com/scribe2013/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SPEEDBALL-CALLIGRAPHY-PEN-SET-525.jpg) with a bunch of different nib sizes. You also should be able to find this at your local hobby lobby/Michaels ect. This comes with a holder and a set of nibs! [See [B.5] FAQs: What is the appropriate nib size?]

**Pointed Pen**: An oblique holder is a necessity, unless you‚Äôre a lefty! The Nikko G are good for starting out as they are a little stiffer. Leonardt Principal EFs are also enjoyed by many..

Recommended: Oblique Holder [Cheap-If you can, get a better one](http://www.paperinkarts.com/spdobl.html) [Nice](http://www.paperinkarts.com/spdper---blu.html) [Nicer](http://www.paperinkarts.com/cenobl.html)
Comment on holders from /u/ZeToast 
> I think the first two are basically garbage that aren't worth any money. It's worth the extra money for the century oblique as a starter holder.

Nibs: [Nikko G](http://www.paperinkarts.com/nikkog.html) [See: [D.3.a] Resources:PointedPen:On Other Nibs]


**Ink:**

Every calligrapher has their own preferences. There‚Äôs a wide range of inks. Fountain pen inks can be used in calligraphy pens, although they don‚Äôt have very good lightfastness since they‚Äôre dye based, not pigmented.

Recommended: [Walnut Ink](http://www.paperinkarts.com/inks-walnut-ink.html) is cheap and great for practice! 

I don‚Äôt want to order online: You can usually find Higgins Black Calligraphy ink at your local art store. [See: [C.3] MISC: Why I hate Higgins Black]

 **Paper:**

Most paper isn‚Äôt sized, or prepared to hold wet media. As a result, ink will spread in an ugly way when applied to a lot of papers. Thus, it‚Äôs important to look for paper that will hold ink well

Recommended: Rhodia or Clairefontaine are recommended by many. I personally have never used them.

I Don‚Äôt Want to Order Online: Drawing paper is often heavily sized. Look in the supplies section of your art store for paper rated for mixed media/wet media/ink.

I‚Äôm Broke: Inkjet printer paper can be a okay substitute. Look for high brightness and high weight.

A note: I suggest starting out with a ream of inkjet printer paper. It‚Äôs cheap and you‚Äôll be throwing away the majority of it when you‚Äôre first starting out and practicing letterforms. The feathering on it isn‚Äôt really that bad. Later, you want to move on to nicer stuff.

Another note: DO NOT BUY ‚ÄúCALLIGRAPHY PAPER‚Äù from your art store. It is almost universally bad and does not hold ink well at all. 

[See [B.7] FAQs: My paper get splotchy/the ink spreads a ton]

---continued in comments----";"Part 2

**[A.5] Okay I got the goods, How do I get started?**

**[A.5.a] Ductus, Pen and Ink.**

Step One: Find a ductus!

A ductus is an alphabet for a script that shows the direction and the order of strokes. Googling for tutorials works. I will post links for the recommended scripts. 

Italic: [This is where I started!](http://www.calligraphy-skills.com/italic-calligraphy.html)

Foundational: [I have no idea if this is good](http://www.calligraphy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Introduction-ot-Calligraphy-Tutorial-Roman-Round-Hand-Guidelines-and-Templates.pdf)


For Pointed Pen Scripts- The [IAMPETH](http://www.iampeth.com/lessons.php) site has a host of resources for pointed pen tutorials. Check them out.

Many calligraphy books will have ducti in them such as Sheila Water‚Äôs Foundations of Calligraphy or David Harris‚Äôs The Art of Calligraphy/The Calligrapher‚Äôs Bible. I was able to find The Calligrapher‚Äôs Bible in my local B&N.

**Step Two: Get Set Up**

**Prepping the pen:**

For cartridge pens, just follow the instructions in the box!

For dip nibs: When you receive new nibs, they are covered in a protective oil. You need to remove this so your ink doesn‚Äôt just blob off the nib. This can be done by 

* using an old toothbrush and some toothpaste

* using some rubbing alcohol

* using some dish detergent 

Assembling the pen: [Shows how to insert the nib and load a reservoir with a brush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rRWyBLrDhs)

**Prepping the Ink:**

Most inks are ready to go out of the bottle! You can dilute them if you want with no ill effect. Please use distilled water to reduce risk of mold growth. Many people like pouring a small amount into another container to reduce contamination in the bottle. 

[Here‚Äôs a few ways to put ink in a dip nib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfqIqPaQeS8)

**[A.5.b] Prepping the Paper and Guidelines:**

Alright guys, we‚Äôre almost ready to start writing! Unfortunately, we have to cover a critical step to good calligraphy: guidelines. Bear with me and we‚Äôll cover some new terms and definitions (with pictures, of course!). Here‚Äôs where the ruler and pencil come into play that I mentioned in the beginning.

Guidelines are what we use to keep our letters in line with consistent size, slant, shape, ect. They are **essential** to learn calligraphy well! If you don‚Äôt use them, the first comment you‚Äôll get here is use guidelines!

Guidelines are composed of four or five parts.

Some terms:

* The baseline: This is where the bottom of your letters touch.

* The waistline or x-height: This is the height of the majority of the letters (x,n,o,m,e,s,a ect), things that don‚Äôt have long stems (ascenders) or tails (descenders). 

* Ascender line: A line for the top of your ascenders such as in l, k, h, f. 

* Descender line: This is where the bottom of your descenders touch such as in p, g, q, and y. 

* Optional Vertical/Slanted lines: These are good to include for reference. If you are learning a script written at an angle (Italic, any pointed pen script) slanted guidelines are a must!

**For BROAD-EDGE**

* Nib width: This is the size of your nib, and how you construct guidelines. A standard guide is 5 nib widths for the x height and 3 each for the ascender and descender lines 

* [Picture](http://www.dancingpencalligraphy.com/imageshl/lines.jpg)

**For POINTED PEN:** From /u/ThenWhenceComethEvil

* Guidelines for pointed-pen don't rely on an x-height. The lines are spaced based on the ratio of your x-height to ascenders. 

* For example, you may have something like this: 3x ascenders (A), x-height, 3x descenders (D), then 1x of spacing before your next line. I use shorthand, so it ends up looking like 3xA,x,3xD,1xs. 

* You can alter the amount of inter-line spacing, or ascender height, to fit the piece you're working on. Maybe you don't like tall ascenders. Go with 2xA or 2.5xA. 

* Almost always make the spacing of your ascenders and descenders match - unless they are mismatched stylistically. 

* [Picture](http://shipbrook.net/guidelines/example.png)

**How To Make Guidelines:**

I‚Äôd start off with printed guidelines. You can use [this](http://www.allunderone.org/calligraphy2/calligraphy.php) generator for broad edge scripts or [this](http://shipbrook.net/guidelines/) one for pointed pen. Alternatively, you can print off a sheet and place it under your paper so you can see the lines under it. If you need to, put a light under both sheets for better visibility.

You can also draw your guidelines. Eventually you‚Äôll have to draw guidelines :P This is literally measuring out the x height, ascender and descender lines, and using a ruler to draw out the lines (I also use a triangle to keep my lines parallel). You can use a [reference sheet](http://imgur.com/a/rql8T) also for quicker guidelines (credit to /u/IowaPharm2014). Also, [here‚Äôs a video guide of how to make guidelines](http://www.monkeysee.com/play/8106-ruling-the-page-for-calligraphy). 


**[A.6] I‚Äôm All Ruled Up‚Ä¶ Now what? How to Practice**

Let‚Äôs get into it!

**USE GUIDELINES**

To begin with, trace over the shapes of the letters many times with a pencil or a nib without ink before you even begin writing. This helps you get a feel for the letters

Every script is comprised of a few basic strokes combined in different orders. Practice the basic strokes- a good ductus should show the strokes that comprise the majority of the alphabet. This serves as a great warmup and it‚Äôs always good to practice the fundamentals.

**USE GUIDELINES**

Practice your letterforms extensively. They form the foundation of anything you do- this is writing, after all. Stay true to the ductus. The best explanation of this I've read is ""Don't veer off and write what you think the letters are. That's the best way to write what they aren‚Äôt."" 

Letterforms are often split into practice groups based off of the similar strokes they share. They differ for every script, but an example of this is m,n,i,u,a,h all share a group in Italic. 

**USE GUIDELINES**

I‚Äôve said use guidelines three times now and because I respect you I won‚Äôt repeat myself anymore because I know you‚Äôll use them :)

Once you have a handle on your letters, you can start forming words! I suggest when you first start out, form words out of the letters that share a group- for example, gaudy, mint or the (in)famous minimum to help you get a feel for spacing between letters and spacing within letters.

The word of the day and the quote of the day are great ways to participate and get feedback on your work, as well as for ideas on what to right if you don‚Äôt have any.


**[A.7] Thanks for Reading! A Closing Statement**

That makes up the majority of the generic of this guide. From now is the specifics. Please see [D] resources for your specific hand! Hope you learned a bit!

One last thing though: don‚Äôt be afraid to post! I hope/think we're relatively nice here :P Especially if you don't have an IRL teacher, this is the best way to help you improve. Post your work and people will offer suggestions to improve, and remember, don‚Äôt take their work as gospel, (don‚Äôt even take my word as gospel). Instead, try it and see what happens!

Hope this helps and good luck.


**[B] FAQ**

**[B.1] My handwriting sucks, can I still learn calligraphy?**

Definitely! You‚Äôll find that calligraphy is totally separate from your everyday handwriting. Calligraphy is different from handwriting in that with handwriting, we don‚Äôt really think about how we‚Äôre writing- we‚Äôre instead thinking about the ideas we‚Äôre writing down. In calligraphy, we focus on making beautiful letterforms. By doing so, anyone can learn calligraphy!

**[B.2] What‚Äôs the difference between fountain pens, cartridge pens and dip pens?**

[Fountain Pens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen) contain an internal reservoir of ink (the ink is inside the pen, not outside of the pen.) They are not suitable for calligraphy- the nibs are usually rounded and have little flexibility- and flexible fountain nibs are quite cost prohibitive.

Please see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/2d0nnb/what_is_a_good_relatively_cheap_option_for/cjkxi7n) thread as to more semantics about the difference between pen groups- /u/cawmanuscript does a better job explaining than I could. That thread will also give you an idea of materials. At the most basic, calligraphers use pens, paper and ink.

Cartridge pens are similar in that they have internal ink, but there are some cartridge pens made specifically for calligraphy. Manuscript and Schaeffer both have lines of calligraphy pens, but these are okay at best and very meh at worst. If you want to learn a broad edge script such as Italic, the Pilot Parallel Pens are recommended for beginners.

Dip pens come from the concept that they are dipped in a pot of ink to write with, rather than having ink inside of them. Now, many calligraphers load their nibs using a brush to transfer ink from the pot to the nib.


 Part 3

**[B.3] What pen is ‚Äúbest‚Äù to start with?**

It depends on the script you wish to learn. If you wish to learn a pointed pen script such as Spencerian or Copperplate you need an oblique holder and pointed pen nibs. This falls under the category of ""dip pens."" There are not any good cartridge pens that I am aware of to learn spencerian.

On the other hand, if you wish to learn broad edge scripts I personally would suggest beginning with Pilot Parallels and then transitioning to dip pens should you enjoy the craft. This falls under ""cartridge pens."" I think learning to handle ink and brush while learning your letterforms becomes a bit much.

**[B.4] What script is ‚Äúbest‚Äù to start with?**

Really, there is none. See the Picking a Script section please! I suggest Italic for broad-edge beginners.

**[B.5] What is the ‚Äúappropriate nib width?‚Äù**

There is none! Nib sizes range from points, the smallest broad edge of .5mm to 3/4"" or larger for poster nibs. When first starting out, we suggest using a larger nib so you can see your errors easier in your letterforms. This usually means 2 mm or larger.

**[B.6] What are reservoirs? Do I need to buy one?**

Reservoirs are attachments to the nib that helps the nib hold ink so you don‚Äôt have to refill it as often. Different brands are different with their reservoirs. For broad edge, speedball nibs come with a non removable reservoir, while Brause nibs come with a removable reservoir. For these two, you do not need to purchase a reservoir. Mitchell nibs on the otherhand, do not come with a reservoir attached and you will need to purchase and put it on separately.

**[B.7] My paper gets splotchy/the ink spreads a ton!**

This can stem from two issues. Either a) you have not removed the machine oil from the nib or b) the paper you are using is badly sized. Please see [A.5.a] Prepping the pen, or [C.4] MISC Sizing.

**[B.8] How do I clean my nibs?**

Pretty much the same way you get the machine oil off of them. I prefer to take an old toothbrush to them and scrub them for a bit. Make sure you dry your nibs off, or they can rust. 

A note on nib cleanliness from /u/terribleatkaraoke: 

> Always have clean water nearby to clean the nib of ink, especially if using sumi. Dried ink on a crusty nib will write like crap, and beginners will think its THEIR fault and be discouraged. A nib should always be perfectly clean everytime it touches paper.

**[B.9] I‚Äôm a lefty. Can I still learn Calligraphy?**

Of course! You‚Äôll just have to do a few things a little different. Please see Resources: [D.4] Lefties for information! 

**[C] MISC**

**[C.1] Fonts vs Scripts vs Hands**

Fonts are used in typography and produced by a computer, while scripts are used in calligraphy and reproduced by a human. A hand is an individual writing a script- the script is the perfect form in the mind, and a hand is what the calligrapher produces with the script in mind.

**[C.2] Other Options for Learning**

If you are in a more urban or highly populated/major city, your location may have a local calligrapher's guild which will have people who can also help you find supplies, as well as teach.

There are also some online workshops you can find in which you post to a forum and have people critique it. Or you could just post here :)

**[C.3] Why I Hate Higgins Black**

Many local art stores carry this crap. Here‚Äôs why I cannot recommend it.

I swear this stuff is regenerating. I've been in this for five months and mainly used it for practice. It has two good points: It'll last you awhile, and its cheap. It's okay starting out, but you'll soon see how gross it is. Good intro material.

Let a pool of it dry in a small bowl or palette thingy and you'll see how disgusting it is. Most inks can be reconstituted with a little water, higgins black can't, (effectively) although you might get a little. It also smells bad. When using a dip nib, black tarry stuff will build up in the reservoir and cause ink flow problems so you gotta clean it, as well as its reaaaally hard to get off your nibs if you accidentally let it dry. I now use it exclusively in pilot parallels when practicing roman, and I'm not bringing the rest to college (1/4th left).

/endrant

**[C.4] Sizing**

Sizing refers to the way the paper is prepared to prevent liquid from spreading. Paper can either be internally sized, where the entire paper is prepared or surfaced sized, in which only the surface is usable. Surface sized paper cannot be corrected with a scalpel and then rewritten on without preparation. Look for paper rated for wet media. Well sized paper can hold a drop of water on it without it spreading- you can also write with water in your pen :)

**[C.5] Flourishes**

Please when just starting out **do not** focus on flourishing/embellishing your letters. It distracts from the focus on the letterforms and swirls do not replace bad letterforms. Once you have a handle on the letterforms, you can branch out and experiment on flourishes. the phrase ‚Äúputting lipstick on a pig‚Äù applies here. 

**[C.6] Fountain Pen Ink?**

Many fountain pen inks are okay to use in calligraphy nibs. However, calligraphy inks are not okay to use in fountain pens. Stay away from inks that contain shellac such as india ink as they will clog your nib and are icky.

[A host of resources](http://calligraphybybillgrant.com/2011/06/01/the-left-handed-calligrapher/) from /u/billgrant43

If you are doing a highly slanted script such as Spencerian or Copperplate, you do not need an oblique holder as a lefty. A straight holder will do.

**[D.3] Pointed Pen**

**[D.3.a] On More Nibs**- From /u/ThenWhenceComethEvil

In regards to nibs:

* Esterbrook 357 is probably one of the best semi-readily available pointed pen nibs. A little more difficult to get your hands on today, as it hasn't been manufactured for a while.

* Leonardt Principal EF is my most used nib. It's very easy to obtain, quite sharp, fairly soft, and the quality control is excellent. Unlike the 303, which is sharp, scratchy, has awful quality control, and is worse in every way. The only real downside to the Principal is in its sharpness. Unless you have a feather-light touch, catching the nib-tines on the paper is a very real issue. Especially in Spencerian/Ornamental Penmanship. Less of an issue with Engrosser's, resulting from the slow and deliberate nature in which it's penned.

* Brause 66EF. I don't use this nib as much as I used to, but it will pull quite fine hairlines and decent shades. It does have a smaller radius than most other nibs, and will be difficult to fit in your standard oblique holder. That is its largest downside.

* Nikko G. It's chrome plated, making it one of the smoothest nibs you'll ever write with. It's also quite large, meaning it will hold a fair amount of ink. While it does pull a decently fine hairline, it's nothing on the Principal or Esterbrook. Also can't get as wide of a shade. Fairly stiff nib. Excellent choice for beginners though.

**[D.3.b] Spencerian**- From /u/terribleatkaraoke

I'd like to break down spencerian into two.. there is a difference between regular spencerian and ornamental penmanship. Here are some regular spencerian examples: [1](http://www.iampeth.com/lessons/spencerian/Real_pen_work/real_penwork_page12.html) [2] (http://www.iampeth.com/lessons/spencerian/practical_penmanship/practical_penmanship_spenerian_page27.html)

and here are some ornamental penmanship (kinda like spencerian on steroids) examples: [1](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/Zaner_certificate.jpg http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/madarasz%2001.jpg)

Regular Spencerian can pretty much be done using any nib because it's more focused on perfect letter forms, hell you can even use a ballpoint pen to do it, although you won't be able to make any shades. Ornamental penmanship is the one where more personal style and swashbuckling is emphasized, and thats where people break out the funny nibs and tools. So I guess for beginners they can always start with a Nikko G, one can do spencerian very well with it and even some OP. That's a good way to start learning, it's quite foolproof and they can study letterforms first. But if they want to graduate to the more serious OP stuff then its better to change to a Esterbrook 357, Principal, vintage Gillotts.. or the other rare vintage nibs.. depends on what they can get really..

**[D.3.c] Engrosser‚Äôs**- From /u/ThenWhenceComethEvil

Examples: 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/JIVn6sa.png) is the best single letter I've ever penned. 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/tDGE9hc.jpg) is some reverse-slant Engrosser's. It's not great, 'cause it's very hard to do. But it was fun.

[This](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/EnriquezEngScrip0001.jpg) is another fantastic sample.

[Engrossers](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/slides/Unknown%200004.jpg)

Tips: 

* Read [my ‚ÄúGuide‚Äù](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1q5auh/engrossers_script_howto_part_1/) on Engrosser's. It has a ton of the information I think people should know about Engrosser's script. Though it is in long-form. I recommend reading all of it. 

* Always stop every ~30 minutes to critique what you've done so far. Put your pen down, and pick up a red correcting pen. Go back and make notes. (i.e., ""watch slant here"", ""work on shade -> hairline transition"")

* ‚ÄùStudy as much as you practice"". This is true with all calligraphy. You need to train your eye as much as your hand. If you aren't able to see what you're doing right and wrong, you'll never improve.

* Shoot me PMs with questions, I'm always available to answer them.


**[D.4] Broad Edge **(Ordered basically how people sent me stuff or I found stuff, to be expanded)

**[D.4.a] Italic**

[An example from me!](http://imgur.com/TxpPi44)

The two key elements of Italic are lateral compression (it‚Äôs based on an oval, so the letters are narrow) and a fluid arch. Italic is characteristic in that it has a ""branching"" structure in that the pen reverses directions at the bottom of the downstroke and goes back up the stem to create the branch. Note on the ductus, m and n are composed of a single stroke.

[Contemporary Italic](http://imgur.com/7Nlw8fB) from /u/cawmanuscript- Once you learn the classical version of a hand, you can adapt it to a more personal and modern version :)

**[D.4.b] Foundational**

[A Foundational Minimum](http://i.imgur.com/ZhegfK2.jpg) from /u/cawmanuscript

**[D.4.c] Uncial** Provided by /u/MShades

Here are a few tips for someone just beginning Uncial:

* Make sure your [o is circular](http://i.imgur.com/xXi23pQ.jpg) - not an oval as would be done in italic hands.

* The x-height is usually 4 nib widths, although 5 can work as well and give it a lighter look. Ascenders and descenders are usually 2 nib-widths.

* When writing, your nib should be at about 30 degrees from horizontal - a little shallower than other hands.

* Practice similar letters together in order to develop a uniform hand. [m/n/u, p/b/d, i/j](http://i.imgur.com/hQQysck.jpg) are letters that often have very similar forms.

* Practice your basic strokes. [Just a few simple shapes make up the Uncial hand.](http://i.imgur.com/fjq1z2V.jpg)

* That said, there is [a lot of variety](http://i.imgur.com/S2wCOVC.jpg) within the Uncial hand. Look around online, and look to [historical sources](http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/illuman/images/full_resolution/9-10_01.jpg) for inspiration. A short overview can be found on [this PDF, pages 10-12.](http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/jmag0042/LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf)

* Uncial doesn't have a separate majuscule (capital letter) form. You can either just use a slightly bigger uncial letter, or look into Foundational majuscules.

* Uncial generally doesn't take a lot of flourishing, [no matter how much you may want to.](http://i.imgur.com/SbdsI3Y.jpg)

**[D.4.d] Roman**

Forming the foundation of much of Western Calligraphy are the Roman Capitals. 

[An intensive thread with a lot of resources, including the Trajan Inscription and lots of stuff from /u/cawmanuscript](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/2cfi16/a_study_of_roman_capitals_feedback_requested/)
 Wow, pretty amazing amount of material here, well done! I'll have to review later. Certainly could probably do with some editing, and some of the sections can doubtless be expanded upon a bit. This is awesome dude! ?üëç?üëè?üëå I'd take out the part where you said fountain pen might be good for spencerian though. No fountain pen can help you seriously learn spencerian. Also the oblique holders, I think the first two are basically garbage that aren't worth any money. It's worth the extra money for the century oblique as a starter holder. Lol.... I think you just rewrote the wiki. xD

This is awesome. But I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with how to incorporate this into what we have going already. <3 [deleted] :) Looking good! None of my links made it in, it looks like. Need them again?

I'll definitely be mining this project for ideas! Yeah of course. plus my formatting didn't copy right, working on it. Also if you could provide a piece as an example of textura and a piece of foundational that'd be great :)

EDIT: I don't know where to put this so I'm putting this here. I'm going to my doctors appointment right now, clean up more formatting and things that disappeared when I get back Edited. If you would like to provide tips or such let me know! Heh. I didn't intend for this to be a replacement for the wiki- just a get started guide. My intention was to make this minimalist especially in the buying section. The wiki is still much more detailed. 

I think that a possible solution could be to move the ""getting started/getting your hands dirty"" section to a new page, as there isn't too much in there that I couldn't incorporate into this/isn't already in this. 

edit: I can try to put this in, but I'm really scared I'd botch something so I'd feel safer on a new page also :P <3 loves for everyone I personally don't do pointed pen so I can't answer this adequately. I would go with /u/terribleatkaraoke's recommendations There's also a section on PP nibs Still editing in formatting! Edit: There you go. [Here you go](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/2e1sx7/a_practice_piece_whereby_i_attempt_to_describe/) buddy. Hope that works for you. Ah ... I can give you a Textura piece but I think someone else should provide an example of Foundational. We have some people here that are at least as skilled at it as I am, and probably a little less coloured by their personal preferences. Go ahead and make a new page then. Link it to the main /index page. You can let the other one just sit there... decrepit. I can still find it in the wiki pages page. Looks like I jumped the gun a bit. :) Great work! Sweet, thanks! Alright. I sent you a PM about it a few days ago. Okay so I don't know how to make a table of contents?? Also I'm having issues with section D.4... Bleh. 
here's where I'm at
http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/getinvolved It was early yesterday morning. :P But yes, I know. Maybe consider someone like /u/thundy84 or /u/dollivarden for a Foundational example as theirs are excellent‚Äîor maybe you can talk /u/cawmanuscript into letting you use his excellent [maple leaf](http://i.imgur.com/NFvZMmm.jpg) piece. Hey!

I just updated the page with the information. I stole the ToC from the index file (always useful to steal so you don't have to retype). The trick for the link is to right-click on the header, once you have that written. Click on 'inspect element'. You'll find a unique identifier string that starts with #wiki. Copy that unique string to the place where you want the link, and viola! Link made! 

I hope that makes sense.  I fixed your links and your headings. :) Definitely /u/cawmanuscript or /u/billgrant43. I'm not up to par!

Thanks for the vote of confidence though! Or /u/read_know_do, since she's been writing that for over a year. :) Haha oh noooes. I'm still a newbie! -- Definitely seconding asking /u/cawmanuscript to use his maple leaf example though. That one's quite nice. Hehe. My schedule is all sorts of whack. It's okay though cuz there's a time zone difference when i move. Done and checked! I figured you might want to look over it before attaching it to the real wiki

Edit: Actually I want to wait until /u/GardenofWelcomeLies responds with anything he has to add :P Thaaanks :) i didn't check the links.  That reminds me, I wonder if Bill is OK‚Äîhaven't seen a post from him for a week and a half now. :| Sure. So long as it's not me. :) Doesn't really matter; I'm a relative newbie as well, and your Foundational is quite good! I think /u/cawmanuscript may decline though. Another great Foundational here is /u/MKTJR but I suspect they will decline for similar reasons to you, which is a pity. You all have great skill at it regardless of how long you've been writing it. Np. It's late here now so I'll check back tomorrow.  I would go ahead and post it; if I have edits to make I can edit the wiki page itself. 

[He must've heard you](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/2dze79/the_wisdom_of_solomon_from_the_loft/) :) :D I got asked for BS and Fraktur. I don't even write Fraktur! But it's nice to be thought of. It's already up on the wiki, just on an isolated page and not linked to anything else yet. Indeed! Glad to see him posting again. :) Hehe for some reason in my mind I recall GoWL saying you had excellent fraktur... Oh well. I guess people will have to deal with my Fraktur :(";61;https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/2dvsui/upoisiondes_im_interested_how_do_i_get_started/;Calligraphy;"/u/poisionde's ""I'm Interested, How do I get started?"" guide Edit: THIS IS BEING MOVED INTO THE WIKI. Current version at http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/getinvolved. Final link posted once people have offered their thoughts.

HI EVERYBODY <3

A quick foreword:

I spent some time putting this together after a compilation of a few comments I have made and other have given me. Feel free to suggest edits in the comments or PM me! My original intent was to write a new intro for the wiki, but it turned into a how do I get started guide that I hope is a little more accessible and easy to understand. If you have trouble understanding any section, please let me know and I‚Äôll edit it. 

If other people have other tutorials, or tips whether hand specific or generic, feel free to share them or PM me and I‚Äôll incorporate them! I‚Äôve messaged a few of you about any examples you would like to provide. As you send them to me, I‚Äôll edit them in. If I sent you a message, I won‚Äôt have incorporated any actual pieces from your history until you give me express permission. Also if I messaged you and you do not want to provide something, please respond so I can make suitable arrangements. Some guides have been added though.  See the disclaimer.

Since I don‚Äôt know how to do the fancy stuff I‚Äôm going to do the old fashioned way of indexing. Use CTRL-F [XXX] to find what you need!

I originally intended for this to be shorter, but it‚Äôs turning into quite a beast. 

[TL:DR](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1wm3pe/a_guide_for_beginners_from_a_beginner/) from /u/Ghazkull. However, I strongly suggest you read through this.

**[A] Step by Step Guide to Getting Started**

**[A.1] Welcome!**

Hi there! Welcome to our little corner of reddit and to the art of calligraphy! 

This post is I‚Äôm-interested-where-do-I-start guide. I‚Äôm trying to make a easier and more accessible guide for new people. For a more extensive introduction and explanation, please see the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/index) on the sidebar!

Disclaimer: I am not endorsed by any brand that I mention, although I wish that I was! Also if I linked to your image/work/site/comment/quote and you don‚Äôt want me to, let me know and I‚Äôll remove it!
Second disclaimer: I, like the intended reader of this, am relatively new to the craft and entirely self taught with no formal training. Thus, do not take my word as law please :) The people linked in the resources are much better than I.

It‚Äôs pretty easy to get started, and cheap too! Here we go :)



**[A.2] The Basics**

Calligraphy is the art of beautiful handwriting! Essentially, we learn a ‚Äúscript,‚Äù or a alphabet with a specific style. The materials are simple: paper, pencil, ruler, ink and a pen!

Let‚Äôs start with some basic terminology. I‚Äôll be explaining most of the terms as we go along, but to begin with, we need to know what a nib and a holder are. These are the two parts that constitute a ‚Äúdip pen.‚Äù 

[Nib](http://imgur.com/C2s4NpQ): The writing part of the pen, or the part that touches the paper, transferring the ink to the paper.

There are two types of nibs, [broad](http://imgur.com/9YjpSJZ) or [pointed](http://imgur.com/O9AAzni). This determines what kind of script you learn. These are two different beasts, so after we look at some examples, decide which one you want to learn first!

[Holders](http://imgur.com/CkZV9nm): This is what you stick the nib into! Broad edge nibs go in a straight holder, and pointed pen nibs go in an oblique holder, unless you‚Äôre a lefty. 


**[A.3] Let‚Äôs Talk about Scripts!**

Now that we got that over with, let‚Äôs talk about scripts! [See: [C.1] MISC Fonts Vs Scripts] There are two major groups of scripts, broad-edge and pointed pen, based on the kind of nib used. Let‚Äôs take a look at some examples of different scripts and see which one you want to learn. 

Broad-edge produces work like [Italic](http://imgur.com/ppUm9Cm), [Uncial](http://i.imgur.com/wvpNipI.jpg), [Bastard Secretary](http://i.imgur.com/tm8BJ79h.jpg) and [Fraktur](http://i.imgur.com/rgdscsi.jpg). We suggest beginning your journey with **Italic or Foundational**, as they‚Äôre less complex and teach the basics well. Remember, you can always learn more scripts later!

(You‚Äôll have to deal with my shoddy examples until people respond with their lovely work!)

The most common Pointed Pen scripts are [Spencerian](http://www.iampeth.com/lessons/spencerian/Real_pen_work/real_penwork_page12.html), [Ornamental Penmanship](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/Zaner_certificate.jpg), Copperplate, and [Engrossers](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/slides/Unknown%200004.jpg). They‚Äôre all different, you can pick which one to start with, although usually there is a progression from Spencerian to Ornamental Penmanship.

Please see the resources at the end of this guide for more in-depth comments on these scripts! Also, check out our [lovely imgur album](http://calligraphyalaphbets.imgur.com) for examples of various scripts. 



**[A.4] Supplies**

I‚Äôve Picked My Script- What Now?

Now that you‚Äôve picked your script, it‚Äôs time to buy some supplies! You really only need three things: paper, ink and a pen! 

A note on this section- this is intended to be as minimalist as possible. There are a wide range of nibs, inks and holders not included for sake of simplicity. A few sites where these are available are at the end.


**The Pen:**

**Broad-edge**: I suggest starting with a cartridge pen, rather than a nib+holder combination. [These](http://cdn.dickblick.com/items/208/81/20881-group3ww-l.jpg) come with non-removable nibs and ink cartridges, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about filling it up. It‚Äôs a lot easier to not have to deal with ink when you‚Äôre first starting out! They‚Äôre very easy to use :) If you buy a cartridge pen, you don‚Äôt need to buy bottled ink separately, although I would buy a pack a refills (they come with a few cartridges, but you‚Äôll eventually have to buy some refills so it may be smart to do it in the same order) [See [B.2] FAQs: What‚Äôs the difference between cartridge pens, fountain pens and dip pens?]

Recommended: The Pilot Parallels 3.8mm(green) or 6.0mm (blue)

I‚Äôm Broke: [Schaeffer Pen](http://www.fendrihan.com/images/SHE73402_Sheaffer_Calligraphy_Broad_FP_green2.jpg) (This is what I started with) or the [Manuscript Pen] (http://www.scribblers.co.uk/acatalog/manuscript_classic_calligraphy_5_set.jpg) Note: You shouldn‚Äôt have to order this online- I was able to find them at my Office Max/Hobby Lobby. These are alright to start out with, but really only marginally cheaper than ordering a Pilot Parallel.

I Don‚Äôt Want to Use a Cartridge Pen: [Buy a set](http://www.scribewritingessentials.com/scribe2013/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SPEEDBALL-CALLIGRAPHY-PEN-SET-525.jpg) with a bunch of different nib sizes. You also should be able to find this at your local hobby lobby/Michaels ect. This comes with a holder and a set of nibs! [See [B.5] FAQs: What is the appropriate nib size?]

**Pointed Pen**: An oblique holder is a necessity, unless you‚Äôre a lefty! The Nikko G are good for starting out as they are a little stiffer. Leonardt Principal EFs are also enjoyed by many..

Recommended: Oblique Holder [Cheap-If you can, get a better one](http://www.paperinkarts.com/spdobl.html) [Nice](http://www.paperinkarts.com/spdper---blu.html) [Nicer](http://www.paperinkarts.com/cenobl.html)
Comment on holders from /u/ZeToast 
> I think the first two are basically garbage that aren't worth any money. It's worth the extra money for the century oblique as a starter holder.

Nibs: [Nikko G](http://www.paperinkarts.com/nikkog.html) [See: [D.3.a] Resources:PointedPen:On Other Nibs]


**Ink:**

Every calligrapher has their own preferences. There‚Äôs a wide range of inks. Fountain pen inks can be used in calligraphy pens, although they don‚Äôt have very good lightfastness since they‚Äôre dye based, not pigmented.

Recommended: [Walnut Ink](http://www.paperinkarts.com/inks-walnut-ink.html) is cheap and great for practice! 

I don‚Äôt want to order online: You can usually find Higgins Black Calligraphy ink at your local art store. [See: [C.3] MISC: Why I hate Higgins Black]

 **Paper:**

Most paper isn‚Äôt sized, or prepared to hold wet media. As a result, ink will spread in an ugly way when applied to a lot of papers. Thus, it‚Äôs important to look for paper that will hold ink well

Recommended: Rhodia or Clairefontaine are recommended by many. I personally have never used them.

I Don‚Äôt Want to Order Online: Drawing paper is often heavily sized. Look in the supplies section of your art store for paper rated for mixed media/wet media/ink.

I‚Äôm Broke: Inkjet printer paper can be a okay substitute. Look for high brightness and high weight.

A note: I suggest starting out with a ream of inkjet printer paper. It‚Äôs cheap and you‚Äôll be throwing away the majority of it when you‚Äôre first starting out and practicing letterforms. The feathering on it isn‚Äôt really that bad. Later, you want to move on to nicer stuff.

Another note: DO NOT BUY ‚ÄúCALLIGRAPHY PAPER‚Äù from your art store. It is almost universally bad and does not hold ink well at all. 

[See [B.7] FAQs: My paper get splotchy/the ink spreads a ton]

---continued in comments---- Part 2

**[A.5] Okay I got the goods, How do I get started?**

**[A.5.a] Ductus, Pen and Ink.**

Step One: Find a ductus!

A ductus is an alphabet for a script that shows the direction and the order of strokes. Googling for tutorials works. I will post links for the recommended scripts. 

Italic: [This is where I started!](http://www.calligraphy-skills.com/italic-calligraphy.html)

Foundational: [I have no idea if this is good](http://www.calligraphy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Introduction-ot-Calligraphy-Tutorial-Roman-Round-Hand-Guidelines-and-Templates.pdf)


For Pointed Pen Scripts- The [IAMPETH](http://www.iampeth.com/lessons.php) site has a host of resources for pointed pen tutorials. Check them out.

Many calligraphy books will have ducti in them such as Sheila Water‚Äôs Foundations of Calligraphy or David Harris‚Äôs The Art of Calligraphy/The Calligrapher‚Äôs Bible. I was able to find The Calligrapher‚Äôs Bible in my local B&N.

**Step Two: Get Set Up**

**Prepping the pen:**

For cartridge pens, just follow the instructions in the box!

For dip nibs: When you receive new nibs, they are covered in a protective oil. You need to remove this so your ink doesn‚Äôt just blob off the nib. This can be done by 

* using an old toothbrush and some toothpaste

* using some rubbing alcohol

* using some dish detergent 

Assembling the pen: [Shows how to insert the nib and load a reservoir with a brush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rRWyBLrDhs)

**Prepping the Ink:**

Most inks are ready to go out of the bottle! You can dilute them if you want with no ill effect. Please use distilled water to reduce risk of mold growth. Many people like pouring a small amount into another container to reduce contamination in the bottle. 

[Here‚Äôs a few ways to put ink in a dip nib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfqIqPaQeS8)

**[A.5.b] Prepping the Paper and Guidelines:**

Alright guys, we‚Äôre almost ready to start writing! Unfortunately, we have to cover a critical step to good calligraphy: guidelines. Bear with me and we‚Äôll cover some new terms and definitions (with pictures, of course!). Here‚Äôs where the ruler and pencil come into play that I mentioned in the beginning.

Guidelines are what we use to keep our letters in line with consistent size, slant, shape, ect. They are **essential** to learn calligraphy well! If you don‚Äôt use them, the first comment you‚Äôll get here is use guidelines!

Guidelines are composed of four or five parts.

Some terms:

* The baseline: This is where the bottom of your letters touch.

* The waistline or x-height: This is the height of the majority of the letters (x,n,o,m,e,s,a ect), things that don‚Äôt have long stems (ascenders) or tails (descenders). 

* Ascender line: A line for the top of your ascenders such as in l, k, h, f. 

* Descender line: This is where the bottom of your descenders touch such as in p, g, q, and y. 

* Optional Vertical/Slanted lines: These are good to include for reference. If you are learning a script written at an angle (Italic, any pointed pen script) slanted guidelines are a must!

**For BROAD-EDGE**

* Nib width: This is the size of your nib, and how you construct guidelines. A standard guide is 5 nib widths for the x height and 3 each for the ascender and descender lines 

* [Picture](http://www.dancingpencalligraphy.com/imageshl/lines.jpg)

**For POINTED PEN:** From /u/ThenWhenceComethEvil

* Guidelines for pointed-pen don't rely on an x-height. The lines are spaced based on the ratio of your x-height to ascenders. 

* For example, you may have something like this: 3x ascenders (A), x-height, 3x descenders (D), then 1x of spacing before your next line. I use shorthand, so it ends up looking like 3xA,x,3xD,1xs. 

* You can alter the amount of inter-line spacing, or ascender height, to fit the piece you're working on. Maybe you don't like tall ascenders. Go with 2xA or 2.5xA. 

* Almost always make the spacing of your ascenders and descenders match - unless they are mismatched stylistically. 

* [Picture](http://shipbrook.net/guidelines/example.png)

**How To Make Guidelines:**

I‚Äôd start off with printed guidelines. You can use [this](http://www.allunderone.org/calligraphy2/calligraphy.php) generator for broad edge scripts or [this](http://shipbrook.net/guidelines/) one for pointed pen. Alternatively, you can print off a sheet and place it under your paper so you can see the lines under it. If you need to, put a light under both sheets for better visibility.

You can also draw your guidelines. Eventually you‚Äôll have to draw guidelines :P This is literally measuring out the x height, ascender and descender lines, and using a ruler to draw out the lines (I also use a triangle to keep my lines parallel). You can use a [reference sheet](http://imgur.com/a/rql8T) also for quicker guidelines (credit to /u/IowaPharm2014). Also, [here‚Äôs a video guide of how to make guidelines](http://www.monkeysee.com/play/8106-ruling-the-page-for-calligraphy). 


**[A.6] I‚Äôm All Ruled Up‚Ä¶ Now what? How to Practice**

Let‚Äôs get into it!

**USE GUIDELINES**

To begin with, trace over the shapes of the letters many times with a pencil or a nib without ink before you even begin writing. This helps you get a feel for the letters

Every script is comprised of a few basic strokes combined in different orders. Practice the basic strokes- a good ductus should show the strokes that comprise the majority of the alphabet. This serves as a great warmup and it‚Äôs always good to practice the fundamentals.

**USE GUIDELINES**

Practice your letterforms extensively. They form the foundation of anything you do- this is writing, after all. Stay true to the ductus. The best explanation of this I've read is ""Don't veer off and write what you think the letters are. That's the best way to write what they aren‚Äôt."" 

Letterforms are often split into practice groups based off of the similar strokes they share. They differ for every script, but an example of this is m,n,i,u,a,h all share a group in Italic. 

**USE GUIDELINES**

I‚Äôve said use guidelines three times now and because I respect you I won‚Äôt repeat myself anymore because I know you‚Äôll use them :)

Once you have a handle on your letters, you can start forming words! I suggest when you first start out, form words out of the letters that share a group- for example, gaudy, mint or the (in)famous minimum to help you get a feel for spacing between letters and spacing within letters.

The word of the day and the quote of the day are great ways to participate and get feedback on your work, as well as for ideas on what to right if you don‚Äôt have any.


**[A.7] Thanks for Reading! A Closing Statement**

That makes up the majority of the generic of this guide. From now is the specifics. Please see [D] resources for your specific hand! Hope you learned a bit!

One last thing though: don‚Äôt be afraid to post! I hope/think we're relatively nice here :P Especially if you don't have an IRL teacher, this is the best way to help you improve. Post your work and people will offer suggestions to improve, and remember, don‚Äôt take their work as gospel, (don‚Äôt even take my word as gospel). Instead, try it and see what happens!

Hope this helps and good luck.


**[B] FAQ**

**[B.1] My handwriting sucks, can I still learn calligraphy?**

Definitely! You‚Äôll find that calligraphy is totally separate from your everyday handwriting. Calligraphy is different from handwriting in that with handwriting, we don‚Äôt really think about how we‚Äôre writing- we‚Äôre instead thinking about the ideas we‚Äôre writing down. In calligraphy, we focus on making beautiful letterforms. By doing so, anyone can learn calligraphy!

**[B.2] What‚Äôs the difference between fountain pens, cartridge pens and dip pens?**

[Fountain Pens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen) contain an internal reservoir of ink (the ink is inside the pen, not outside of the pen.) They are not suitable for calligraphy- the nibs are usually rounded and have little flexibility- and flexible fountain nibs are quite cost prohibitive.

Please see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/2d0nnb/what_is_a_good_relatively_cheap_option_for/cjkxi7n) thread as to more semantics about the difference between pen groups- /u/cawmanuscript does a better job explaining than I could. That thread will also give you an idea of materials. At the most basic, calligraphers use pens, paper and ink.

Cartridge pens are similar in that they have internal ink, but there are some cartridge pens made specifically for calligraphy. Manuscript and Schaeffer both have lines of calligraphy pens, but these are okay at best and very meh at worst. If you want to learn a broad edge script such as Italic, the Pilot Parallel Pens are recommended for beginners.

Dip pens come from the concept that they are dipped in a pot of ink to write with, rather than having ink inside of them. Now, many calligraphers load their nibs using a brush to transfer ink from the pot to the nib.


 Part 3

**[B.3] What pen is ‚Äúbest‚Äù to start with?**

It depends on the script you wish to learn. If you wish to learn a pointed pen script such as Spencerian or Copperplate you need an oblique holder and pointed pen nibs. This falls under the category of ""dip pens."" There are not any good cartridge pens that I am aware of to learn spencerian.

On the other hand, if you wish to learn broad edge scripts I personally would suggest beginning with Pilot Parallels and then transitioning to dip pens should you enjoy the craft. This falls under ""cartridge pens."" I think learning to handle ink and brush while learning your letterforms becomes a bit much.

**[B.4] What script is ‚Äúbest‚Äù to start with?**

Really, there is none. See the Picking a Script section please! I suggest Italic for broad-edge beginners.

**[B.5] What is the ‚Äúappropriate nib width?‚Äù**

There is none! Nib sizes range from points, the smallest broad edge of .5mm to 3/4"" or larger for poster nibs. When first starting out, we suggest using a larger nib so you can see your errors easier in your letterforms. This usually means 2 mm or larger.

**[B.6] What are reservoirs? Do I need to buy one?**

Reservoirs are attachments to the nib that helps the nib hold ink so you don‚Äôt have to refill it as often. Different brands are different with their reservoirs. For broad edge, speedball nibs come with a non removable reservoir, while Brause nibs come with a removable reservoir. For these two, you do not need to purchase a reservoir. Mitchell nibs on the otherhand, do not come with a reservoir attached and you will need to purchase and put it on separately.

**[B.7] My paper gets splotchy/the ink spreads a ton!**

This can stem from two issues. Either a) you have not removed the machine oil from the nib or b) the paper you are using is badly sized. Please see [A.5.a] Prepping the pen, or [C.4] MISC Sizing.

**[B.8] How do I clean my nibs?**

Pretty much the same way you get the machine oil off of them. I prefer to take an old toothbrush to them and scrub them for a bit. Make sure you dry your nibs off, or they can rust. 

A note on nib cleanliness from /u/terribleatkaraoke: 

> Always have clean water nearby to clean the nib of ink, especially if using sumi. Dried ink on a crusty nib will write like crap, and beginners will think its THEIR fault and be discouraged. A nib should always be perfectly clean everytime it touches paper.

**[B.9] I‚Äôm a lefty. Can I still learn Calligraphy?**

Of course! You‚Äôll just have to do a few things a little different. Please see Resources: [D.4] Lefties for information! 

**[C] MISC**

**[C.1] Fonts vs Scripts vs Hands**

Fonts are used in typography and produced by a computer, while scripts are used in calligraphy and reproduced by a human. A hand is an individual writing a script- the script is the perfect form in the mind, and a hand is what the calligrapher produces with the script in mind.

**[C.2] Other Options for Learning**

If you are in a more urban or highly populated/major city, your location may have a local calligrapher's guild which will have people who can also help you find supplies, as well as teach.

There are also some online workshops you can find in which you post to a forum and have people critique it. Or you could just post here :)

**[C.3] Why I Hate Higgins Black**

Many local art stores carry this crap. Here‚Äôs why I cannot recommend it.

I swear this stuff is regenerating. I've been in this for five months and mainly used it for practice. It has two good points: It'll last you awhile, and its cheap. It's okay starting out, but you'll soon see how gross it is. Good intro material.

Let a pool of it dry in a small bowl or palette thingy and you'll see how disgusting it is. Most inks can be reconstituted with a little water, higgins black can't, (effectively) although you might get a little. It also smells bad. When using a dip nib, black tarry stuff will build up in the reservoir and cause ink flow problems so you gotta clean it, as well as its reaaaally hard to get off your nibs if you accidentally let it dry. I now use it exclusively in pilot parallels when practicing roman, and I'm not bringing the rest to college (1/4th left).

/endrant

**[C.4] Sizing**

Sizing refers to the way the paper is prepared to prevent liquid from spreading. Paper can either be internally sized, where the entire paper is prepared or surfaced sized, in which only the surface is usable. Surface sized paper cannot be corrected with a scalpel and then rewritten on without preparation. Look for paper rated for wet media. Well sized paper can hold a drop of water on it without it spreading- you can also write with water in your pen :)

**[C.5] Flourishes**

Please when just starting out **do not** focus on flourishing/embellishing your letters. It distracts from the focus on the letterforms and swirls do not replace bad letterforms. Once you have a handle on the letterforms, you can branch out and experiment on flourishes. the phrase ‚Äúputting lipstick on a pig‚Äù applies here. 

**[C.6] Fountain Pen Ink?**

Many fountain pen inks are okay to use in calligraphy nibs. However, calligraphy inks are not okay to use in fountain pens. Stay away from inks that contain shellac such as india ink as they will clog your nib and are icky.

**[D.3] Pointed Pen**

**[D.3.a] On More Nibs**- From /u/ThenWhenceComethEvil

In regards to nibs:

* Esterbrook 357 is probably one of the best semi-readily available pointed pen nibs. A little more difficult to get your hands on today, as it hasn't been manufactured for a while.

* Leonardt Principal EF is my most used nib. It's very easy to obtain, quite sharp, fairly soft, and the quality control is excellent. Unlike the 303, which is sharp, scratchy, has awful quality control, and is worse in every way. The only real downside to the Principal is in its sharpness. Unless you have a feather-light touch, catching the nib-tines on the paper is a very real issue. Especially in Spencerian/Ornamental Penmanship. Less of an issue with Engrosser's, resulting from the slow and deliberate nature in which it's penned.

* Brause 66EF. I don't use this nib as much as I used to, but it will pull quite fine hairlines and decent shades. It does have a smaller radius than most other nibs, and will be difficult to fit in your standard oblique holder. That is its largest downside.

* Nikko G. It's chrome plated, making it one of the smoothest nibs you'll ever write with. It's also quite large, meaning it will hold a fair amount of ink. While it does pull a decently fine hairline, it's nothing on the Principal or Esterbrook. Also can't get as wide of a shade. Fairly stiff nib. Excellent choice for beginners though.

**[D.3.b] Spencerian**- From /u/terribleatkaraoke

I'd like to break down spencerian into two.. there is a difference between regular spencerian and ornamental penmanship. Here are some regular spencerian examples: [1](http://www.iampeth.com/lessons/spencerian/Real_pen_work/real_penwork_page12.html) [2] (http://www.iampeth.com/lessons/spencerian/practical_penmanship/practical_penmanship_spenerian_page27.html)

and here are some ornamental penmanship (kinda like spencerian on steroids) examples: [1](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/Zaner_certificate.jpg http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/madarasz%2001.jpg)

Regular Spencerian can pretty much be done using any nib because it's more focused on perfect letter forms, hell you can even use a ballpoint pen to do it, although you won't be able to make any shades. Ornamental penmanship is the one where more personal style and swashbuckling is emphasized, and thats where people break out the funny nibs and tools. So I guess for beginners they can always start with a Nikko G, one can do spencerian very well with it and even some OP. That's a good way to start learning, it's quite foolproof and they can study letterforms first. But if they want to graduate to the more serious OP stuff then its better to change to a Esterbrook 357, Principal, vintage Gillotts.. or the other rare vintage nibs.. depends on what they can get really..

**[D.3.c] Engrosser‚Äôs**- From /u/ThenWhenceComethEvil

Examples: 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/JIVn6sa.png) is the best single letter I've ever penned. 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/tDGE9hc.jpg) is some reverse-slant Engrosser's. It's not great, 'cause it's very hard to do. But it was fun.

[This](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/EnriquezEngScrip0001.jpg) is another fantastic sample.

[Engrossers](http://www.iampeth.com/artwork/slides/Unknown%200004.jpg)

Tips: 

* Read [my ‚ÄúGuide‚Äù](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1q5auh/engrossers_script_howto_part_1/) on Engrosser's. It has a ton of the information I think people should know about Engrosser's script. Though it is in long-form. I recommend reading all of it. 

* Always stop every ~30 minutes to critique what you've done so far. Put your pen down, and pick up a red correcting pen. Go back and make notes. (i.e., ""watch slant here"", ""work on shade -> hairline transition"")

* ‚ÄùStudy as much as you practice"". This is true with all calligraphy. You need to train your eye as much as your hand. If you aren't able to see what you're doing right and wrong, you'll never improve.

* Shoot me PMs with questions, I'm always available to answer them.


**[D.4] Broad Edge **(Ordered basically how people sent me stuff or I found stuff, to be expanded)

**[D.4.a] Italic**

[An example from me!](http://imgur.com/TxpPi44)

The two key elements of Italic are lateral compression (it‚Äôs based on an oval, so the letters are narrow) and a fluid arch. Italic is characteristic in that it has a ""branching"" structure in that the pen reverses directions at the bottom of the downstroke and goes back up the stem to create the branch. Note on the ductus, m and n are composed of a single stroke.

**[D.4.c] Uncial** Provided by /u/MShades

Here are a few tips for someone just beginning Uncial:

* Make sure your [o is circular](http://i.imgur.com/xXi23pQ.jpg) - not an oval as would be done in italic hands.

* The x-height is usually 4 nib widths, although 5 can work as well and give it a lighter look. Ascenders and descenders are usually 2 nib-widths.

* When writing, your nib should be at about 30 ";;
;;;;;;egrees from horizontal - a little shallower than other hands.;;
;;;;;;;;
; p/b/d; i/j](http://i.imgur.com/hQQysck.jpg) are letters that often have very similar forms.;;;;* Practice similar letters together in order to develop a uniform hand. [m/n/u;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;* Practice your basic strokes. [Just a few simple shapes make up the Uncial hand.](http://i.imgur.com/fjq1z2V.jpg);;
;;;;;;;;
; there is [a lot of variety](http://i.imgur.com/S2wCOVC.jpg) within the Uncial hand. Look around online; and look to [historical sources](http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/illuman/images/full_resolution/9-10_01.jpg) for inspiration.

;;;;;;;;
; or look into Foundational majuscules.;;;;;* Uncial doesn't have a separate majuscule (capital letter) form. You can either just use a slightly bigger uncial letter;;

What is the best starter pen(s)?;"I‚Äôm looking to get into calligraph and was wondering what the best pen is for beginners to practice with. I‚Äôm looking at broad edge, the FAQ recommends Pilot Parallels. Would one Parallel be good enough? Do I need to buy ink to put in the Parallels or is the ink it comes with good enough for a beginner? Can I use regular notebook or printer paper for practice, or does it really need to be special paper? Would a pen other than the Parallel be best?
Thanks";"Calligraphy is a term that holds a big umbrella of different options under it.
Parallel pens are great for Blackletter, Gothic scripts. The cartridges that come with are not great. Black is OK, brighter colors are pretty bad. Yes you will need an ink resistant paper like Rhodia or Clairefontaine because of how much ink the lay down. I recommend getting a syringe and fountain paper ink to refill the cartridges.
Other options for Calligraphy would be other types that are often confused with ""handwriting"" or ""cursive"". For those, Fudenosuke Brush Pens and copy paper will work great. I mean copy paper is also a pretty generic thing to say because there are a lot of variations there too. Canson Marker xl paper is nice and not expensive.
Try YouTube channels like Daily Lettering (who is also a member of this Sub) and the Happy Ever Crafter. For Blackletter stuff try looking up Tamer Gonheim videos.
They all 3 have blogs and advice on the materials to get started.
I can't believe I just typed all this.
And most importantly always have fun. Parallel pen is very easy to handle. You need either cartridges for it (1-2 should carry you through an evening of practice), or ink to dip it into. I personally prefer cartridges, but you do you.

1 pen is enough for the first attempts. I find 6mm easiest, the size makes it easy to see what I'm doing. But recently, I'm really starting to live the 3mm too.

My suggestion: buy a 6mm, a box of black cartridges, and the mixed color box (over here, it comes with the pen). If you're having a lot of fun, buy a second pen to check other sizes. I think the best starter fountain pen is a Lamy. They are relatively inexpensive and a great pen to write with. I have several Lamy pens. I have many other brands, hi-end and some that cost 10-12 bucks, but I always come back to my Lamy fountain pens. ?üòÄ Get a holder, a pack of nibs, a pot of ink and some paper meant for calligraphy (so your ink doesn‚Äôt spread). 

Holders/nibs are universal in my experience, so you can upgrade piecemeal without starting over. And the nib sets give you a couple different sizes and shapes so you can practice a variety of different styles.

I know Etsy has a lot but I'm not sure which of those sets would be considered best style - I found one by Calligrascape (heres the link to see what it entails https://www.etsy.com/listing/1176547127/master-blackletter-calligraphy-practice?ref=cart) and it has 8 scripts included - Textura, Fraktur, Batarde, Rotunda, Italics, Uncial, Roman and Neuland) - and the price isn't bad at all. I like the look of both Textura and Fraktur, but anyway ... It helped me learn to trace the starting strokes and such for Copperplate to get a feel for sizes/shapes and things of that sort and over time I could move on to making words once I know what the heck I'm doing lol.

So my question overall is, would this be a decent one to start learning the basics or is a different vendor (more well known name or something) a better choice? Does anyone have any suggestions that might be better for traceable Mini and Majuscules and so forth?

is the pilot vanishing point worth it?;"i have mainly been using Kaweco Sports (EF and F are too fine) and Kaweco Perkeo (F is a nice size). i recently got a TWSBI eco and find the EF too thick. am currently thinking of a Pilot VP F but the price range is a lot more than what i‚Äôve paid for a pen before (max $70 to a mid $200)

i don‚Äôt mind paying more for the pen but i‚Äôd like to hear some advice from those who have used it before! 

also, if there‚Äôs any singaporean vp users here, please share where you got your pens from! ";"Hi OP, Singaporean VP user here. I got my VP from Think at Funan. Look for T, he's a great guy.


Yes I love my VP. I have a gorgeous black and gold one which I can't stop clicking. I think it really depends on what you‚Äôre planning to use it for. Mine is one of my favorite work pens since most of my use case there is note taking, often in places where I don‚Äôt want to deal with a cap. When I‚Äôm working in a theater in the dark or a scene shop and there‚Äôs no table it‚Äôs amazing. But for longer periods of writing or when I‚Äôm drawing I basically never reach for it or even just when I‚Äôm actually at my desk. Then I want something a bit more comfortable or more visually interesting. Or with a bigger ink capacity.

They‚Äôre comfortable pens but not the most comfortable. The modern ones can be a bit large and heavy depending on your hand size, the older ones are lighter and a bit smaller. The nib is excellent, it‚Äôs smooth, a nice level of wetness, and reliable. But its also quite small and mostly hidden by the pen body so if you like visually interesting nibs there‚Äôs nothing for you here. The converter is also not great and Pilot‚Äôs better ones are either out of production (con-20 and con-50) or don‚Äôt fit (con-70). That being said you can always refill cartridges and the VP is a great pen to do that with. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that despite being retractable the seal is quite good. Both of mine have sat unused for a month or so before and still worked perfectly the next time I picked them up.

Overall I like them enough that I‚Äôve bought two vanishing points and a handful of Majohn‚Äôs clones. They don‚Äôt see as much use as some of my other pens but for what they do their unparalleled and I‚Äôd happily recommend them I like it, but it's on the heavier side, it's finicky and if you like seeing the ink level, annoying to impossible. also, you will learn fast why that converter is the most disliked one. I don‚Äôt have a VP, but I usually do my FP-related shopping at Fook Hing at Bras Basah Complex or Think at Funan level 2 (I prefer Think, the Japanese dude at the FP counter is super nice and knowledgeable). For me? Absolutely. I have a VP, a Decimo and most recently a Fermo. I used to worry about the clip being in the way, but after buying a Majohn A1, I found it doesn't get in the way and didn't mind paying for the VP. I got mine used. You could check out the [SG Fountain Lovers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/143950065676244) for meetups to test write with one and maybe even ask if someone is looking to sell theirs.. Generally yes. I can do sort of a mini review of mine, which i've had for a year now, my point of comparison will be my lamy 2000 which i've had for 6 years. 


My VP is a classic gold and black with a medium 18k nib. 


The good:


-super smooth writer, the 18k is not only smooth but very bouncy, but don't be tempted to flex! Because you will make the tine gap wider very easily, it's a pen for light hands. 


- beautifully built, the lacquer is very deep and gives a sense of quality. The brass body is weighty, but not overly so. 


-Ergonomics: the pen is quite thick, which means the clip in the section is not really a problem, because you are not going to put your fingers in it, but this also depends on how you hold your pens and hand size, i use a standard tripod grip and my hands are medium to large for reference.


-Super pratical: no caps! 


The bad: 


-mine has mild baby's bottom, which means the first stroke after sitting for a while comes dry. 


-awful converter, you can get it fully filled if you really really really really want to, but it is so fiddly it's not worth bothering with.


-mine has started to developped pitting corrosion on the clip which is a bummer, i may try to send it to pilot.

Overall it's a good pen, but if you don't care too much about the capless mechanism, the 2000 is to me, a better  more reliable pen (subjective, this is controversial, vp vs 2000 is a debate as old as time lol). 

Hope i helped and happy writing! [UPDATE] thank you everyone for your honest feedback! this was really such a warm welcome to the subreddit as well. major thanks for also sharing a dupe? honestly the biggest thing urging me to get the vp was the matte black body, hence the reluctance to pay the price. have bit the bullet and bought the majohn A1. fingers crossed it works out! VP Decimo is really good for the price, 18k gold nib feels noticeably bouncier and smoother than the Pilot steel counterparts. I mean, it is just a pure joy to write.

You would expect a ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù mechanism like this would spoil easily or require extreme care, but surprisingly no. I‚Äôm no pen abuser but my partner is, and if given the choice he would just toss the pen into his bag, never clean, among other things. His VP shows sign of use after some 3+ years but working like a champ. 

So yes, overall I‚Äôd say worth it. It‚Äôs a very unique mechanism, smart design that prevents drying out of the nib despite being capless, great nib, comes in many fun colors and trimmings. I‚Äôm quite sure it is meant for quick note-taking thanks to the click mechanism, but I never have any issues with longer writes.

Visit Think shop at Funan since you are in Singapore. The shopkeeper gentleman will let you try pens and inks to your heart‚Äôs content, and he offers really good advice. I bought my VP at the end of 2022. I'm an engineering student at university so I'll speak of it through that lens.

I really like the ease of using it. Having that smooth nib combined with the convenience of a traditional clicky ballpoint pen is a wonderful idea. The clip doesn't really bother me that much, and the nib has a pretty large sweet spot so even when I am on those tiny desks in lecture halls I write very well on that.

One thing I dislike is that it is very difficult to see the ink capacity, since it uses the Con-40. The section where you put the converter in makes it almost impossible to see the ink level in the converter unless you take it out, and that dirties your fingers. It also is a bit heavy, so if you have smaller hands it might be fairly difficult to write with for longer periods of time. I have large hands, so the weight is fine and evenly distributed for me imo.

Overall, I really like the pen, and it is a staple in my EDC rotation. It's super convenient and easy to use, and I highly recommend it. If you are a little worried I could recommend using the decimo first and then moving to the VP. YES

https://preview.redd.it/08lx4wapxtyc1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ece7ca81fa4c749eced5d6e83bf96245bd60a050 100 percent absolutely yes Depends, I have a vp and a decimo and would I buy it again? No. I don't think it's worth it because to me, it's kinda boring both in nib and looks, but that's just me. Maybe you'll like it or maybe you'll dislike it 

Just get a manjohn a1 or a2 first and try it to see if you think the practicality of it is worth it or not I'd say no. 

You can get a reasonably good copy from Majohn to find out for yourself. 

If you upgrade from there then be careful with the nib choice. The F is very fine, the M is rather broad and wet, the FM is not widely available outside of Japan, but might be what you are looking for. I have a Decimo (M) and a Majohn A1 (F), and I like them both, but the nibs feel very different: the A1 is a nail, while the Decimo has quite some bounce. Depends on your use case. 

When I was working in the lab a lot I used my VP a lot. The primary reason for this honestly is that I wanted a pen that I did not want to cap and uncap since that's a two hand operation. The VP makes using your pen a one hand operation.  Since I've transitioned to a different role, I've gone back to using a capped pen. The capped pens just hold more ink. 

To be honest the vanishing point runs great but the premium that you pay for is for the one hand vs two hand operation. I have a large collection, and far and away the vanishing point is my most frequently used pen, it's just too convenient and functional. I love and use my VP for editing (long form fiction). Otherwise, I don't know if I would use it. It works well, but editing is the only need I have for a constant on/off use pen which makes the retractable a great pen for me. It depends.  I have one and I don't regret it.  That said, it's a special edition and I don't use it on a daily basis.  It's just not very interesting to use and the small size tires out my hands after a bit.  It's probably the last pen I reach for.  But this is the pen I will bring if I know I'll be out and about taking notes.  It's convenient. Just buy vp from carousell or just buy them directly from Japan. VP are built really well since their body is made of brass. 

If not shops like fook hing or aesthetic bay have them. You could always try the Majohn A1 and see if you like the feel of it, much cheaper if you like the finer nibs (widest it comes in right now is F). I love mine and am planning to put a pilot VP (M) nib unit in it eventually. Yes and I love mine so much if I can only keep one pen from my collection that includes some multi thousand dollars pens, I'll still choose a VP. Yes it's worth it! (edit to add: Yes, there's a copy, and I will get one soon probably, but I also like paying a premium to have the brand thing because I'm a little prick) Yes a Pilot VP or Capless is worth it.  If you want to spend less, get the Capless special alloy nib.

They are super easy to use and very elegant. I absolutely love my VPs. I like fine nibs from Pilot, but I've heard the medium ones are really nice. One of mine I use every single day. Yes worth it! Havent bought any VPs here in SG, usually buy it from JP (whenever I go there or if I have friends going there i ask them to buy for me), but i do buy my inks at fook hing... Get Moonman A1 and see how you like the feel of it. That being said I also want a VP but after getting A1, I feel this is good enough for ‚Ç¨20 I‚Äôve got a growing collection of VP‚Äôs. I‚Äôm mobile for work and absolutely love the convenience. Worth it is up to the individual give the price. You can get copies but I love the originals. Very hard to get a better combination of aesthetics, reliability, and ease of use. I find it over rated. Try the Majohn ones and see. They are as good if not better imo. warm welcome to this sub!!!! don‚Äôt forget to join the ‚ÄúSingapore Fountain Pens Lovers‚Äù group on FB too if you need more local tips or want to see what‚Äôs up with other SG folks and their FPs :) 

They have some cool meetups at times, lots of great advice, a local buy-sell FPs group, and also don‚Äôt forget to mark the date for Pelikan Hub!!! It‚Äôs on Sep 22 each year, and Singapore will have a Pelikan Hub too :) It‚Äôs just a cool meetup (will likely have a small ticket price to cover the venue rental cost and cost of snacks) and you get a Pelikan full-size ink too as a door gift. Might be fun to socialize with other FP lovers :) haha i love the enthusiasm but is there a why? yeah that‚Äôs where i‚Äôm leading now. tbh the aesthetics of the matte black vp is what i got for hahah so ive no issues wrt aesthetics. i‚Äôm a little concerned about the majohn drying out tho? based on what i‚Äôm reading online that seems to be a major issue? manjohn nibs are awful in the a1.

Get a Pilot Capless with special alloy nib.  Lower price than a gold nib pen, and excellent build quality. why would I swap a VP I already have for a Majohn? Those 18k nibs are just pure joy. Also it‚Äôs quick click to write is quite handy. Doesn‚Äôt dry out. But main reason being the writing pleasure they give. Just fabulous I have a Majohn and it's fantastic, it probably dosen't seal as well as the pilot, but I believe thats if you leave it for a month or so, and even then it'll be fine after a couple of letters I used to have the a2 for about a month before I gave it to my niece and I don't think it's that bad but the nib that I got on mine was horrendous but with a little bit of high grit sand paper I got rid of the scratchy feel in less than 5 minutes You could try the Moonman converter though. It‚Äôs much better than the CON-40. It works in the Pilot pens. I was replying to OP";12;https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1clbpo3/is_the_pilot_vanishing_point_worth_it/;fountainpens;"is the pilot vanishing point worth it? i have mainly been using Kaweco Sports (EF and F are too fine) and Kaweco Perkeo (F is a nice size). i recently got a TWSBI eco and find the EF too thick. am currently thinking of a Pilot VP F but the price range is a lot more than what i‚Äôve paid for a pen before (max $70 to a mid $200)

Get Moonman A1 and see how you like the feel of it. That being said I also want a VP but after getting A1, I feel this is good enough for ‚Ç¨20 I‚Äôve got a growing collection of VP‚Äôs. I‚Äôm mobile for work and absolutely love the convenience. Worth it is up to the individual give the price. You can get copies but I love the originals. Very hard to get a better combination of aesthetics, reliability, and ease of use. I find it over rated. Try the Majohn ones and see. They are as good if not better imo. warm welcome to this sub!!!! don‚Äôt forget to join the ‚ÄúSingapore Fountain Pens Lovers‚Äù group on FB too if you need more local tips or want to see what‚Äôs up with other SG folks and their FPs :) 

They have some cool meetups at times, lots of great advice, a local buy-sell FPs group, and also don‚Äôt forget to mark the date for Pelikan Hub!!! It‚Äôs on Sep 22 each year, and Singapore will have a Pelikan Hub too :) It‚Äôs just a cool meetup (will likely have a small ticket price to cover the venue rental cost and cost of snacks) and you get a Pelikan full-size ink too as a door gift. Might be fun to socialize with other FP lovers :) haha i love the enthusiasm but is there a why? yeah that‚Äôs where i‚Äôm leading now. tbh the aesthetics of the matte black vp is what i got for hahah so ive no issues wrt aesthetics. i‚Äôm a little concerned about the majohn drying out tho? based on what i‚Äôm reading online that seems to be a major issue? manjohn nibs are awful in the a1.

Get a Pilot Capless with special alloy nib.  Lower price than a gold nib pen, and excellent build quality. why would I swap a VP I already have for a Majohn? Those 18k nibs are just pure joy. Also it‚Äôs quick click to write is quite handy. Doesn‚Äôt dry out. But main reason being the writing pleasure they give. Just fabulous I have a Majohn and it's fantastic, it probably dosen't seal as well as the pilot, but I believe thats if you leave it for a month or so, and even then it'll be fine after a couple of letters I used to have the a2 for about a month before I gave it to my niece and I don't think it's that bad but the nib that I got on mine was horrendous but with a little bit of high grit sand paper I got rid of the scratchy feel in less than 5 minutes You could try the Moonman converter though. It‚Äôs much better than the CON-40. It works in the Pilot pens. I was replying to OP";;
Received today Pilot Vanishing Point, great pen but returning it tomorrow.;;"This is a special alloy (steel) version of the Pilot Capless. It‚Äôs a Japanese domestic model. They are cheaper than the 14k vanishing point versions. Ironically enough, the steel version nib is *gold* colored and the 14k gold nib is *silver*.

As far as the rattling, are you sure you assembled it correctly? Also, the con-40 converter has metal balls inside that rattle - it‚Äôs perfectly normal if that‚Äôs the converter you are using. I think the ""rattle"" comes from the CON-40 ball bearings that are inside of it :) - if yours came with one.

In that case, the rattling is normal.
If you don't like it, swap to cartridges and the rattling will be gone.

If it rattles for other reasons, no it is not normal with the VP. Honestly the con-40 is so bad that I just refill cartridges. This removes the rattling issue and give you almost double the ink capacity. Never used the special alloy version but I love my gold nib in fine so much! Why? Neither my VP nor Decimo rattle  I use cartridges with the provided sleeve. You can keep the pen and buy an additional gokd nib unit. Nothingvwrong with steel nibs -- unless you6a gold nib snob. ?üòâ Couldn't resist a great deal on this pen from Amazon Australia and pulled A$160 trigger yesterday.

The pen is actually good, despite it has strange yellow nib with 1116 mark on it, not a casual ""14k"". The biggest wow for me is how effortless it writes - Fine nib just glides above the paper! And I would love to keep it but one very annoying issue with this specific pen makes me turn it down: it rattles when I either write fast, or do a fast stroke from left to right (opposite stroke doesn't cause any rattling).

It is definitely a good pen and well deserved the hype around it, but I just cannot tolerate rattling for A$160. However after experiencing once gold nib it's actually hard to get back. Mine doesn‚Äôt rattle. Might be something broken or assembled wrong. I don't understand the 1116 mark, that's very confusing. The gold colour also doesn't fit with the rest of the pen. It makes me wonder if it's authentic. [deleted] [removed] It must be an Amazon thing because I only see them with actual gold nibs. I own two. One with a stub and the other a medium nib. Both write well and neither pen rattles. The V P pens are incredibly convenient, particularly in a situation where you are constantly picking up and setting down the pen, such as when taking notes. I am pretty sure it's pen itself as I was using cartridge. And I tried to reassemble it few times as I always assume that I am the problem first. I used cartridge, probably should specify that in my comment. Also rattling noise was much louder than what CON40 is capable of. That‚Äôs probably the case. Con-40 has 3 small metal balls while other converters are single larger ball or no ball at all. I was a bit shocked when I encountered one Absolutely agree with you. Also just refilling the cartridges, so balls in convertor definitely aren't the cause of the rattle. It noticeably rattles while writing. The 1116 is the month (November) and the year (2016) of the manufacturing of the nib.

That is NOT a gold nib. Pilot marks their gold nibs with a 14k or 18k below their logo. My Decimo (thinner body than Vanishing Point, same mechanism and nib unit) does not rattle. Nib unit extended or retracted. So I might believe you got a faulty item. [deleted] Capless special alloy nibs are gold plated. It seems like some of the JDM pens brought to Australia from Japan directly (also the name of the seller was something about Japan Shop or something), but I agree with you about the confusion. Yes, it is gold color, all steel Capless nibs are gold plated. Prolly thr converter, it has small ball bearings inside. There are no known poor quality knockoffs of the Capless. There is just the A1 which is clearly marked Moonman. They don‚Äôt distribute the steel nib version outside of Japan, that‚Äôs likely why you‚Äôve never seen anything but gold nib versions. Did you break it down to top section (plunger assembly), nib unit and bottom section and individually shake each separately? If none rattled than it could be the cartridge striking the side of the tube (since you said that you did not use the Con-40). You did use the [cartridge metal cap](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-and-Decimo-Metal-Cartridge-Cap/pd/14188), right? Was it firmly seated in its grooves? Maybe it's the opening assembly, say a loose spring. I doubt it was a loose nib rattling back and forth inside the Section cover. I would expect the plunger assembly (knock?) to rattle back and forth when there is no metal cap to prevent it from moving. Then is not normal... returning it is a good decision. Did you try switching to cartridge? That‚Äôs a shame. I love mine. That's interesting, and actually makes me feel better about returning this pen. Although that is strange that pilot makes non-gold nibs in gold color, while gold nibs in silver color :D I was searching the internet for any rattling issues before deciding on return and didn't find any similar issues so that's probably a defective unit. I don't know as I didn't own any other VPs before, but that's something I definitely couldn't live with considering the price paid. I don't mind to add another $30-40 and buy something like Pilot E95S, or Platinum Maki-E, if they would provide similar writing experience without making any rattling noises. I saw someone else commented on what the 1116 is, but I agree it's not a gold nib. It should have been stamped 18K750. Glad you're returning it. Can easily understand why, it writers so smooth, and so convenient to use on the go. White (silver) nibs are more often white gold 18k nibs. The E95S with a converter that has an agitator WILL rattle as will any other pen. Unless, again, the VP has an actual defect.

On the other hand - the E95S has a VERY different feel to the VP. It is (at least in its medium variant) buttery. Amazing. Super amazing pen. The 1116 is the date of manufacture - Nov (11) of 20(16).

This, however, is NOT a gold nib. It is a gold-coloured nib.

As for rattling - the rattling probably comes (as others already suggested) from the ink agitator in the converter. If you want to be certain - remove the converter and the nib assembly from the pen and see if anything still rattles. I think Pilot often plates their gold nibs with Rhodium to give them this silver look‚Äìmatching the silver trim I personally don't like pilot converters, all I have (CON40 and CON20) are meh at best, so I prefer to refill cartridges with syringe instead. Better ink capacity and less issues overall. Just for comparison - here are my vanishing point nibs, a Pilot 18k from Sep 2010, a Namiki 14k from Sep 1998 and a Pilot 14k from Apr 1991.

https://imgur.com/a/65YRIX0 I was using the cartridge, and nib insert wasn't rattling when I was using it along without installing in the pen. So I am pretty sure that the pen's body was the issue.

However thanks for clarifying that mistery 1116 number for me. This is correct.  Most 14k/18k nibs are rhodium plated and not white gold. Yes, I agree about the mehness of Pilot converters. I use converters and empty cartridges interchangeably, but wish the converters were better. Aha.

Opinions on Pilot Vanishing point?;What'd y'all think of it?;"I think it's one of the best fountain pens ever made.  I even like the Majohn knockoffs. I like them in the broader nibs.

They can be strange to hold (because they force a grip that some may not find comfortable).  I suggest you find one to hold before buying.

I like having an actual grip section, I know metal ones (like the Lamy Studio) don‚Äôt really work for me, but man I wanted a VP. The clip was always annoying, no matter how much I adjusted my grip. I also found I had to be careful with the way I clicked it, since my second one would always push out a tiny little drop of ink, like the click was too forceful though it wasn‚Äôt.  Idk, it‚Äôs a polarizing pen I guess, you either love it and think it‚Äôs the best, or you don‚Äôt. I absolutely love mine. The ink capacity kills me. I have not tried refilling a cartridge though.

I have one EF and I love it! Because well with an EF ink lasts. But I had a Stub and ink just did not last, so I sold it.

Not good for long writing sessions, your hand will get tired. Perfect for quick notes and bullet journaling. They're really nice pens. As other mentioned, the grip can be awkward at times and the pen is a bit heavy but the writing experience with those nibs is pretty incredible. Not the most comfortable pens, but the clicky mechanism is really handy for note taking, and they're great at blending in as normal pens if you don't want to answer questions or have people ask to try your fancy pen You either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. Try one if you can get your hands one first. If you hate the grip, try it again after 6 months and then again after 6 months. If you still hate it after that, then it's not for you. If you love the grip, this is going to be one of the best pens you would ever have. You can try to use jinhao 10 or majohn a1 to get the feel. Once you are comfortable with the grip, get a gold nibbed pilot. The nib is miles ahead. I got one last week and this is my most used already with occupying 90% of the writing time. I know others have mentioned the clip and it‚Äôs definitely a divisive feature. My vp is by far the heftiest pen I own - I got mine a few days ago and it‚Äôs much heavier than any other pen I have and I feel like it‚Äôs wider, too.

But other than that I really like it so far! Im pro vanishing point and pro capless LS. I love them all. Clip helps me straighten out my writing. I find the modern VP bulbous and ugly, especially the cheap-looking nosecap (which unfortunately carried over to the Decimo), and the fat clip a little intrusive. Great nibs, very useful concept; but Majohn's clipless A1 is more comfortable to hold, their A2 is a better size, and the older facetted VP with integrated nose and clip a far, far better looking and handling pen.

(FWIW I own one of each of the above except the Decimo.) I think it is an evil invention of the devil, a driving force behind forcing well-brought up geeze from employment as feather providers to honest quill makers and, in general, a depraved invention of Machinatus Scribus, the machine god of writing.

And now - to something completely different.

What do you mean by ""what'd y'all think of it?"" There are multiple types of VP - from the most sedate black and chrome modern VP's, through Decimos, to LS. That, in itself, is not all - one can fairly easily get one's hands on older versions of the VP, from its previous generations, some of which have become legendary (i.e. faceted). And then there are the limited editions and the radens! Och, the radens!

As a pen, the previous generations and the Decimo are very nice and pleasant in the hand, write well and can be used, by people with OCD, to drive people with ADD up the fucking wall (by clicking during large meetings). I am less fond of the LS and the modern VP - they are a bit too heavy and thick. But that is I - others are willing to sell their own grandmother for a raden. Sell all THREE of their grandmothers. Mine has the very best fine nib of any pen I‚Äôve ever used.  Never dries out either.  
But I realise I may have got lucky.  :) I love mine so much. I anticipated being bothered by the clip position,  it I‚Äôve found that it allows me a few different grips, and I like the variety. Dynamic tripod, lateral tripod, and a weird one where I grip behind the clip (like holding a paintbrush, I suppose) all work for me with this pen. Personally I really like them, both the full size and the slightly smaller diameter decimo. I know that the clip placement and how that affects grip can be a deal breaker for some though. I think they're virtually unparalleled for quick start and stop writing but a bit meh for longer use.

  
Expanding on that, if I'm running around a theater, or checking in on the carpenters and painters in the scene shop, or scribbling something down while building a model to showcase a new design concept my vanishing point is the thing I grab. It has a great nib that's comfortable to write with on a variety of papers, a clip that holds it securely in place in my pocket no matter what I'm doing, and it can be operated with one hand and has no cap to potentially misplace. The one handedness is especially nice for a few of those situations when I've got all manner of paint, adhesive, or nasty laser cutter dust on my other hand. On the other hand if I'm sitting down and writing or drawing for a longer period of time most of its upsides don't really matter as much and some of its downsides become more apparent. For example, its ergonomics which are fine but nothing special, and I say that as someone who isn't bothered by where the clip is. it's an awesome pen, one of my favourites for short notes. Smooth and dependable. It‚Äôs the only pen I‚Äôd buy in a heart beat again if I lost it. Try one on store if possible to ensure clip placement won‚Äôt be an issue. And if not, take the leap. I bought one for taking quick notes and love it for that purpose. I don't find it as comfortable for long (multi-page) writing sessions. I had the chance to see the Majohn one and ... yes... pretty much the same thing. even the nib was very good. This is the way. The clip placement is very divisive. Some people can't stand it. I don't mind it at all.

And if that is a deal breaker, Majohn has clipless versions. Agree RE ink capacity. Mine has a rather broadish medium nib; I use it a lot for work and find myself refilling it often‚Ä¶¬† I love the faceted Capless. I wasn't expecting to like it that much.

It has a great nib that's comfortable to write with on a variety of papers, a clip that holds it securely in place in my pocket no matter what I'm doing, and it can be operated with one hand and has no cap to potentially misplace. The one handedness is especially nice for a few of those situations when I've got all manner of paint, adhesive, or nasty laser cutter dust on my other hand. On the other hand if I'm sitting down and writing or drawing for a longer period of time most of its upsides don't really matter as much and some of its downsides become more apparent. For example, its ergonomics which are fine but nothing special, and I say that as someone who isn't bothered by where the clip is. it's an awesome pen, one of my favourites for short notes. Smooth and dependable. It‚Äôs the only pen I‚Äôd buy in a heart beat again if I lost it. Try one on store if possible to ensure clip placement won‚Äôt be an issue. And if not, take the leap. I bought one for taking quick notes and love it for that purpose. I don't find it as comfortable for long (multi-page) writing sessions. I had the chance to see the Majohn one and ... yes... pretty much the same thing. even the nib was very good. This is the way. The clip placement is very divisive. Some people can't stand it. I don't mind it at all.

And if that is a deal breaker, Majohn has clipless versions. Agree RE ink capacity. Mine has a rather broadish medium nib; I use it a lot for work and find myself refilling it often‚Ä¶¬† I love the faceted Capless. I wasn't expecting to like it that much. It isn't bulky, it's light enough and the grip is comfy for me. The modern one doesn't do it for me aesthetically. I want to try a decimo.";;
No one told me about the dangers of a Pilot Vanishing Point!;"So while I was taking notes in a meeting today, I managed to stab myself in the thumb (flipped the pen the wrong way and rather forcefully clicked the nonexistent  button.) 

It impaled itself about 2mm, drawing blood! ?üò≥

I accidentally stabbed myself with a VP EF nib once ( dont ask me how ) , I was surprised to find that it actually went through the first layer of my skin.  
No wonder I could write a Kanji so small that my eyes could barely recognize it !

*you WILL lose that thumb should you disappoint us* Vanished into your pointer, eh? It's how we recognize each other in the yard. A tattoo. All the gangs do it I‚Äôve done this so many times! A few months ago, I stabbed myself nib-swapping a Sailor EF for a zoom. After finishing the task, I walked up to a family member while brandishing my tiny wound and pen, proclaiming, ""An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age"" ... I only got a blank stare and an ""ok?"" but I was satisfied. I love my VP. Only the strong survive So glad your pen is ok! I know nibs aren't the greatest risk, but do be careful with puncture wounds, and make sure your tetanus shot is up to date. (Sorry, jeweler with healthy concern for puncture wounds.) I did it with a broken Curidas knock-off. I got it because I wanted to see if I liked the design before buying the expensive one. The spring got stuck in the knock-off, and the pen slipped when I tried to pry it loose. It went pretty deep, and it hurt for a day or two. After that,  I gave up on the terrible fake Curidas. Throwing it away was actually very satisfying! Yeahhh, done this a couple times. It hurts like hell, and I always jab my thumb down so confidently, making it worse. lol. Me two days ago and many times before that. Freaking hurts but so worth it lol. ohhh i am so glad the nib wasnt damaged by your thumb.

I did the same thing with my Majohn A2 on Monday. Now I have a little tattoo. That's one way to sign your Faustian contracts. I see one of these every week I swear Why I prefer stubs! 100% feel your pain Oh no!!!! Poor nib. You‚Äôre messing with Gold. ?ü§™
Glad you‚Äôre ok. try their 1.1 stub. it's even more dangeros it seems. 

it's more of a crisp italic than a stub, you can probably cut paper with it :P Been there done that. Stopped using them. Common sense and awareness is so tiring.

But did the EF still work?! (Mine is a medium) I've also stabbed myself with my VP EF-- twice, in the same instance. It rolled off my desk, bounced nib down on my leg, then bounced nib down further down my leg. To make matters worse, I was in the middle of learning about necrotizing fasciitis, which to prevent you from a gory Google, is an infection that gets through a skin barrier, like a graze or a cut. Yeah I did it with a Platinum UEF. Which is why I prefer stubs now. Yikes! I'm sorry - it hurts. ?üòü For sure. This pain will not change my mind! Ahh, yes! I am fortunately up to date on all of my shots and no signs of infection so far. As a hobby jewelry maker, can't tell you how many times I've stabbed myself with various wire!

There is a blue-black dot on the back of my hand that I have had for well over a decade now. Sadly. That is my only tattoo. Can't afford body art as well as my other hobbies.

Pilot Vanishing point;I‚Äôve been thinking about Pilot‚Äôs vanishing point pen and I‚Äôve read different reviews on it. I‚Äôm undecided because I like the idea of having a push button vanishing point but many people are unhappy with the position of the clip. What‚Äôs your opinion?;"If you have a Pilot Metropolitan, leave the cap on and pretend to write as if the nib were coming out the top of the cap.  If the clip is pointed at the ceiling while you pretend to write, then you're not likely to have a problem with the VP's clip.  If the clip is pointed in some other direction than straight up, then there's a chance you'll have a problem.

Alternately, if you can't find a comfortable grip with the Metro's clip, then the same will probably be true of the VP.

You could always try a clipless Majohn retractable... The clip issue is >>>>   grossly overrated. 

I love mine. I barely notice the clip at all. I own a VP and a Decimo. I find the clip entirely ignorable and not an issue for me at all. I hold any pen in the standard tripod grip, right-handed. I never notice the clip at all, other than it does provide an anchor point of sorts and helps you more easily ""right"" the pen so the nib is aligned to the paper when you're about to start, but I see it as a very minor thing either way on either size pen body. In fact, I'm strongly considering getting another nib size for my full-size VP.

FYI, I'm a 5'11"" 200lb guy with decently large hands that can almost but not quite palm a basketball if that gives you a sense of my size / grip.  


EDIT: Just realized I find it not entirely dissimilar to the triangle grip section on a Lami Safari / AL-Star. It's just that tiny separation where your thumb and first finger have the peak of that grip between them. At least I find somewhat comparable. If you have a nonstandard grip you may not love it, but I adore mine A lot of it depends on how you use your pens. I'm more of a note jotter, and I often use 3-4 pens on a single page and rarely more than a sentence or two at a time. So the clip doesn't bother me. 

However, it may become cumbersome if I'm writing an entire page with it. It's a great note jotter pen, but may not be the best long form pen to write with. Try a Majohn A1. It's a cheap way to find out for sure. I was concerned prior to purchase, but I quickly realized it was a non-issue as soon as I wrote with it. I have 3, so the clip obviously doesn‚Äôt bother me. the clip isn't a problem for me at all and it has a great nib (though i do have problems with it not writing right away but like half way through the first stroke) Clip doesn‚Äôt bother me at all I really like the clip. Good reference point for finger position. Doesn't get in the way at all for me. I also have a dialog CC, which has a roll stop instead of a clip. Of the two, I prefer a clip to a roll stop. So I have a clipless A1 and 3 Pilot VPs and a Pilot Decimo.

I prefer the clip.  Removing the clip makes the pen body extra annoying.  The clip is actually very useful for gripping the pen.   Just remember the internet shows you at least 80% of the people who don't like the clip, and <1% of the people who like the clip.

The A1 is a fine pen, but it is no Pilot.  The A1 nib is finicky and has weird sweet spots.  

I don't consider A1 a good introduction to a Pilot VP because you can get a Pilot VP for around $100 on Amazon, and Pilot VP is going to be rock solid.  You can get a Pilot Capless for less.  The yen is cheap right now, so buy quality Japanese pens that will last you your lifetime instead of 3 mediocre pens. Buy 2 Mahohn A1 pens, one with clip and one without. Reassemble them to that you end up with a clipless pen that also has no roll stop. Then put a Pilot VP nib unit in it (since they're interchangeable) and you have an entirely smooth pen body with a VP nib. The only real difference will be that the mechanism on the A1 will a bit rougher than the VP and likely less durable over time.

In any case, I have a VP, a Decimo, 2 A1s and an A2. The clip doesn't bother me -- in fact, it becomes a nice novelty and guide for not rolling the pen as I write. The clip doesn't bother me. In fact, I have a Moonman A1 without a clip but I prefer the VP with the clip because I can pick it up and orient my grip without ever having to look at it. I have a non-standard grip and hate the VP clip with an abiding passion. I lurv my clipless Majohn A1's. After I got my first, I immediately ordered several more. It's not as smooth a writer as the VP, but it's decent. Isn‚Äôt there a clip delete option now? Don‚Äôt want to advocate for cheap Chinese copies but some get very good reviews for a tiny fraction of the price. I‚Äôm waiting on one coming before I bite the bullet on an original. HATE the pen because of the clip. One of my favorite Pilot nibs. 

What did I do?  Got rid of my VP, bought a Majohn A1 (clipless), bought a pilot VP nib unit, and made a pen I like since the nib unit fits in the A1. Love my creation. I don‚Äôt know why Pilot doesn‚Äôt make a clipless. The Pilot VP is a phenomenal pen and any penthusiast should definitely have one.  I did not find the clip an issue. I have medium (Asian size hands). Try the Mahjohn rip-off if you want to be sure. I was unsure about the clip, and although it feels unusual compared to other fountain pens having it there, it should be fine if your grip is fairly standard, or if you use a poor grip it may well help you correct it I had a VP and didn‚Äôt like it but never could figure out why and assumed it was the clip that everyone else spoke of‚Ä¶ until I tried a Decimo.  I found that the size of the standard barrel was uncomfortable but the slightly smaller Decimo fit my hands much better and am now a big fan of the VP I just moved the clip. You can only move it so much, but it made a huge difference for me. It depends on how you hold your pen. If  you use a regular tripod grip it shouldn't be a problem. I've had mine for about three years now.  The clip has no affect whatsoever. Oh, love your Metropolitan‚Äôs example, thanks! I find that it's actually helpful as a guideline to see if you're holding it the correct way or not. I'm unsure if I'd enjoy a VP without the clip as much. I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô 230lb guy that can palm a basketball, and I feel the same exact way about the clip. Solid answer. And actually a decent pen!

Edit not saying the VP isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd love one, just for the price you‚Äôre not only getting a test drive but a good pen also. THIS 100% The insides are interchangeable, so you could swap a VP nib into the A1. :) You're welcome! Indeed! I won't have any issues with the VP then. Christmas pen, here I come! I took that route. I now own three A1, a VP, and a Decimo with a custom grind.

NPD! Pilot Vanishing Point faceted;;"When I first saw this pen online I just had to get one! The design is so beautiful the clip also seems to be stonewashed or something so you don‚Äôt get fingerprints all over it (which really annoys me), very clever from Pilot!

Unfortunately the pen isn‚Äôt that comfortable for me to use, I‚Äôm a lefty and I hold my pen in a weird way where I wrap my thumb around the pen body.. well there‚Äôs a clip in the way now and it‚Äôs fine for quick notes but annoying for longer writing.

I really love this pen and it‚Äôs in really good condition too but I think it‚Äôs either going to be a pen to look at instead of one I‚Äôll write with. I really don‚Äôt like to treat my pens like garage queens, they‚Äôre supposed to be used, so perhaps, with a broken heart, I‚Äôll sell this one eventually Ôºà ÔΩâ _ ÔΩâ Ôºâ Which VP model is this? Love the integrated clip! Is this a discontinued model? Looks great, too bad it doesn't really suit you.

Maybe one day .... :-) Congrats! A stunner every time I look at it ;) Ink?? Great handwriting for a lefty. Fantastic handwriting, the ink and the subtle shading fits very well.
Always wanted that pilot but I am a bit turned off by the clip position.

Nonetheless, superb by dude. That feel when I just know it's your post Matt. I was sitting with my friend, while on reddit and then saw your post, ""ay this is one of my friend's posts!"" Very nice!  I still have a navy blue one I bought when they were released. I haven‚Äôt actually inked it up in many years‚Ä¶maybe I should. Hey, as a lefty I also used to have a very similar grip to you and couldn‚Äôt use my Lamy Safari. I also got a few inks that took a longer time to dry so I decided to fix my pen grip problem and my side writing problem. It took about 2 ish months and now my handwriting is better than before, ink doesn‚Äôt smudge, and I can write with my Lamy. As a german dude, I have to say: I like dutch and I like to read it. Similar to german, but different on its own. Beautiful handwriting, too. Lovely pen! I've got a black one that someone randomly gifted my father some years ago.

It's a shame it doesn't fit your writing style, because I agree with you: I have a modern VP and I like this one more.

I think the Decimo or the [Capless LS](https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-capless-ls-fountain-pen/) are a little closer on design and size to this one, but I don't have either one to compare them to.

Maybe the LS fits you a bit more since the clip is a bit higher on the body?

Either way, great handwriting and lovely pen! Hi! How do you fill the converter the most? With the limited ink capacity of the converter, is it advisable to fill the ink to the converter brim? Or is it also advisable to fill through the filler hole by inserting my syringe there? I‚Äôm also not too keen with the clip in the way, but love the nib so much! A good looking pen you have! It‚Äôs funny because we have the same grip (I‚Äôm right handed though), with the thumb around, but I actually like the clip. It makes the pen slide around less. This is a model from 1994 ([according to this page](http://carmenriverapens.com/Vanishing_Point_images/94JanRet.htm)).

They weren‚Äôt made for that long and I really don‚Äôt get why, this clip makes them look so much better and it‚Äôs also less obtrusive than the clip on the modern VP‚Äôs.

I believe the modern nib units also fit  in this pen, making it a great pen to buy when you have a VP with an amazing nib but prefer this design :) I don‚Äôt tend to hold onto pens that don‚Äôt suit me for very long :) 

I‚Äôve sold a beautiful old style Sailor 1911L because it was a fingerprint magnet and I hate that. The pen wrote well and was almost like new.

I also sold a Sheaffer Crest with a conical nib to a friend of mine, the pen was uncomfortable for me to use (too slim) but it was an amazing writer, absolutely godlike nib. \^_\^; I‚Äôm glad I sold it to a friend, that means I get to use it from time to time :)

Also, judging by your username.. I think we‚Äôre countrymates :) The writing on the page wasn‚Äôt done with the VP :)

The brown ink you see at the top is KWZ Cappuccino, the ink at the bottom of the page is Noodlers Turquoise. Haha thank you!

None of the writing on the page was done with this pen though, I was actually studying the notes I made a while back but I felt the need for a picture :) Is it really THAT obvious?! („É?_Ôºú) You really should! 

A pen is supposed to be used and I think you‚Äôll definitely enjoy writing with it again :) I switch it up sometimes :)

- When I‚Äôm in a hurry or don‚Äôt want a mess I‚Äôll fill the converter with a syringe but not to the bring, slightly below the metal ring.

- When I want a good fill and don‚Äôt mind wiping ink off the nib for a minute or two, I will put the converter in the nib unit and suck up the ink through the nib unit into the converter. In this case the feed will also hold part of the ink which allows you to write longer before having to refill.

- Sometimes when I don‚Äôt have a converter I‚Äôll fill an empty Pilot cartridge with another ink, this also holds more than the converters :) I believe the modern nib units also fit in this pen :) 

This one has a medium nib and it writes pretty good but I would‚Äôve preferred a fine or even extra fine. I would invest in another nib unit for this pen but sadly the clip is in the way. 

[Here‚Äôs](https://imgur.com/a/0xcVjJK) a writing sample I made with it to show it to a friend, sorry for the terrible lighting and the inky fingers \^ - \^

You can see how I wrap my thumb around the pen, not the most ideal way to hold a pen I must admit (‚åí-‚åí; ) \[\[Apologies in advance for being a bit pedantic\]\]

From what I know, the vintage VPs of the faceted model were  actually produced from 1984 and stopped their production run either late 90's or very early 2000s, shortly after (what was) the modern vanishing point design was introduced. This is a pretty neat resource with the timeline: https://www.pilot-capless.jp

The Namiki branded VPs are an American market pen, and the ones branded Pilot, like the one you have was a European market pen. Everywhere but North America, I believe the Pilot is supposed to be referred to as the Pilot Capless, the Namiki Vanishing Point is a North American specific branding (the speculation is because Namiki sounds more luxurious than Pilot which might have been thought of as a stationary brand). I believe the Namiki branded VPs only started production in 1994, but the Pilot ones had been around for a decade before that. 

The integrated clip is even older, originally stemming from the 1973 Capless model which is an aluminum bodied pen with the nice, brushed cap. 

The specific colour might be a later year, but the model definitely existed in black with silver trimmings since the 80s.

Fantastic pen though! It's a shame the pen doesn't work for you but it's awesome that you got to try one out for yourself. I don't think it is limited edition so it will be hard to tell from the body color.  if you have the original nib you can see date stamp on it.   Also 14K is more desired nib than 18K.  So if you want to you can sell it and get contemporary nib.

If you decide to sell burgundy facet VP, I would love to know.  ?üòÅ [deleted] Thank you! Sooo what pen did you use then? Yeah For me it is ?üòÜ Indeed!  Maybe next round of ‚Äúcurrently inked‚Äù.  Enjoy your burgundy beauty. Oh great! Lotsa options! Thanks for helping this newbie out! :) I think everyone holds pens differently so I do agree with you that the clip does give me the impression your hand will get fatigue a bit. It‚Äôs a shame though bc the nib is extremely good. I hope you‚Äôll keep it for a longer before parting with it!

How quickly does your Pilot Vanishing Point dry out?;I‚Äôve read and heard mixed opinions about this. It‚Äôs my last sticking point about whether to buy one. Could people relay their experiences, please, and I‚Äôll decide based on the majority opinion. Thank you in advance for your thoughts!;"I have an extra-fine VP filled with Pilot's Iroshizuku ink that has chilled in its box for the majority of the last year, since I don't really use it much, and it writes instantly whenever I do bring it out. Mine does have hard starts but doesn't dry out. When I think it has dried out I find it empty. Mine never seems to dry out when it's retracted, but it does have a bit of a hard start if I don't write with the nib out for about thirty seconds. I‚Äôve owned two, one vintage and one modern, and the longest I ever let them sit without being used was about a month. They were both still working perfectly at that point and potentially could‚Äôve been left linger but I never pushed it. The only times I ran into issues with them drying out was when I used particularly dry inks, in those cases I tried to avoid letting them sit for more than 2 ish weeks. There was a good YouTube video about this a couple of weeks ago. 
Here‚Äôs the link https://youtu.be/dPwYdbcg_GY?si=D6B1n7LrK8Tai76Z 

Fwiw, my capless A2 doesn‚Äôt dry out (but I do use it every day.) I‚Äôve only just got my Pilot Vanishing point so I can‚Äôt tell you about performance yet, but I have high expectations! Both of mine seem to dry out if not used for more than 24 hours‚Ä¶

However, reading this sub I do seem to be in the minority. Will be interesting to see if anyone else experiences the same. I have 4 modern VPs (VP with EF, Decimo with EF, Fermo with F, Raden with M)

They all easily last weeks of not being touched and write instantly when picked up. 



As someone else pointed out though, the humidity of your environment does affect things. Dryer atmosphere means faster dry-out. 

For reference I am in a fairly dry city (\~20-30% avg humidity). So clearly Pilot is doing a good job designing those flaps. So far, never. This is after three or four years. The answer depends on your environment.  Do you live in an arid environment where evaporation happens quickly?  It may be a problem.  Do you live in a more humid environment where evaporation can take eternity?  No problem.

There may be some variation from pen to pen.  Also, the ink can make a difference - highly concentrated inks have less water to lose and evaporation quickly makes them decline to flow.  Private Reserve's Infinity line may help even more (I'm not sure on this, but since it's designed to support longer cap-off-and-idle time, it seems like it's designed to not evaporate quickly).

FWIW, I have two VPs (fine nib) and a Decimo (EF) and live in an arid environment (northern Utah) and while pens like the Jinhao x750/x450 and Waterman Kultur will show observable evaporation overnight, my VPs have not had that problem.  Note that I use them every day when inked.  I recommend against pigmented, glitter, high sheening, and otherwise concentrated inks.  Go with something that has water to lose - unless you're in an environment where the air is nearly saturated with water, in which case, use whatever ink you like. :) I have a fine VP. I leave it inked, but the nib retracted all the time. Writes fine. If I leave the nib out, it will dry quickly (like don't leave for a lunch with it open on your desk). It will start writing again.   
I do use pilot ink in it at this time. I wouldn't use any shimmer ink in it. 

  
The only time I couldn't get it to write, it had no ink left in the cartridge and I had left it for more than 6 months that way. Had to flush out the nib, but it works great. Mine is several weeks old and it hasn't dried out yet. It's my new favorite pen. Bad news for my other inked pens. Highly recommend the Doodlebud YT video covering this subject. I generally have 8-10 pens inked, and I keep them upright in a cup (in pen sleeves). Because they are nib up my 2 Decimos generally will evaporate a bit (ink is darker right at first), and this winter I needed to dip them in water to get them to write right away. However, if I leave them lying horizontally they start immediately with minimal dry out. I'd rather keep them nib up because anything lying on my desk is at a risk of being knocked onto the floor! I have an EF w/Namiki Black. Goes months without use, and has never dried out. My Decimo was inked two months ago, do not use it daily and it writes every time. Ink starts out slightly darker when I write with it. The vanishing point is prone to ink drying in the trap door which causes it to not seal all the way and making the nib too dry. Clean out the trap door by (1) soaking it while holding the trap door open with a toothpick or paperclip or (2) repeatedly spraying water. 

You will need to do this from time to time depending on how you fill the pen. It's best to take the nib out and not dip the whole pen in as this causes more ink to get inside. I thought that dipping the whole pen + nib in ink would make it more wet since this wets the fins of normal pens but this actually causes ink to dry and prevent a proper seal in the closed position (since the VP doesn't have a cap, the trap door is essentially what keeps it capped).

Found it out from this thread and it worked on my vanishing point that I thought was just too dry. Writes wetter than my Parker 51 now. https://old.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/k8k24k/help_vanishing_point_dries_up_after_a_day_of_not/gezpggg/ It‚Äôs my every day pen so it does not go long amounts of time without being used. But I‚Äôve gone on trips and left it inked at home. Not a hint of dry after even three to five days. I find some of my screw cap pens will. The only other ones I have that do not are a twsbi eco and a Kaweco sport al. I find the vanishing point more impressive in most regards than I expected going in. At which point after you uncap the pen does the ink vanishes ? I have M and B nib that don't dry out if not used for a few days. It has yet to dry out, which is quite impressive; I'm more susceptible to this as I'm using 70ish pens and like inks to come out consistently. I use mine off and on and have left it inked for up to two months at a time and it hasn't dried out. In the three and a half years I have had it it has never dried out. I haven't had any trouble except when it was pushed too deep into a pen case partially depressing the button.¬† I've had mine for a couple of years; maybe longer.  It has never dried out.  No skips, no hard starts.  A great, practical pen. I cleaned mine out and pointed a flashlight at the opening (im looking at it from the middle, the flashlight at the trap door) and i can see lighting coming through around the edges of the trap door. My pen body does not have an air tight seal at all I purchased one last month.  It is a broad nib.  I originally inked it with Robert Oster Viola and I had some flow issue with the pen.  After the 2nd day, I flushed it and put in Pilot ink, much better.  My pens seems to want  a wetter ink.   It took awhile but I do like the pen.  It feels more like a ballpoint to me.  So far the pen flows well.  I had used it in a week, it did have a hard stop but immediately worked right after.  I did notice darkening of the ink so there was some evaporation but nothing more than my other snap cap pilots.  

Would I purchase another one, no.  Do I like the one I have, yes only because it is so different.  Otherwise, I could have saved the money for a different pen.  The problem is that Pilot does not make cheaper model pens with different nibs and i wanted a B nib and I like metal bodies. This was my best option for the money. Mine doesn‚Äôt have dry out issues. There‚Äôs no reason to worry about dry out related to leaving the nib deployed because it‚Äôs not a practical issue. The Decimo is my most used pen. I own a bunch (~6). Two are always inked and 1 often sits unused for a while. Never an issue of drying out and basically writes instantly even after a couple weeks/months sitting. This exactly; and the converter is tiny so it runs empty more frequently than I like ?üò≠ Doodlebud is great! I have one that does this and one that doesn't. Wonder if there's any fix for this issue Mine too, alas. Tell me you have a cat, without telling me you have a cat. ?üòè Thank you for this excellent reply No cats, two small dogs. I have a very cluttered desk, and I'm clumsy! I don't take credit, all I did was google it when it was happening to my vanishing point then tried it on my pen. It worked! So then I tried to reply to the threads where I saw nobody had replied about the trap door yet.

One thing I do notice though is that no matter how you fill up your pen, the nib will always end up touching the trap door when you open it. It probably spreads the tines a bit to help ink flow out of the nib but over time it will probably end up getting ink on the trap door and you'll have to clean it again. 

It's better to fill up by taking the nib out and dipping rather than dipping the entire pen with nib and trap door, but you'll still need cleaning. ?üôÇ";26;https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1c6xp6v/how_quickly_does_your_pilot_vanishing_point_dry/;fountainpens;"How quickly does your Pilot Vanishing Point dry out? I‚Äôve read and heard mixed opinions about this. It‚Äôs my last sticking point about whether to buy one. Could people relay their experiences, please, and I‚Äôll decide based on the majority opinion. Thank you in advance for your thoughts! I have an extra-fine VP filled with Pilot's Iroshizuku ink that has chilled in its box for the majority of the last year, since I don't really use it much, and it writes instantly whenever I do bring it out. Mine does have hard starts but doesn't dry out. When I think it has dried out I find it empty. Mine never seems to dry out when it's retracted, but it does have a bit of a hard start if I don't write with the nib out for about thirty seconds. I‚Äôve owned two, one vintage and one modern, and the longest I ever let them sit without being used was about a month. They were both still working perfectly at that point and potentially could‚Äôve been left linger but I never pushed it. The only times I ran into issues with them drying out was when I used particularly dry inks, in those cases I tried to avoid letting them sit for more than 2 ish weeks. There was a good YouTube video about this a couple of weeks ago. 
Here‚Äôs the link https://youtu.be/dPwYdbcg_GY?si=D6B1n7LrK8Tai76Z 

Fwiw, my capless A2 doesn‚Äôt dry out (but I do use it every day.) I‚Äôve only just got my Pilot Vanishing point so I can‚Äôt tell you about performance yet, but I have high expectations! Both of mine seem to dry out if not used for more than 24 hours‚Ä¶

However, reading this sub I do seem to be in the minority. Will be interesting to see if anyone else experiences the same. I have 4 modern VPs (VP with EF, Decimo with EF, Fermo with F, Raden with M)

They all easily last weeks of not being touched and write instantly when picked up. 



As someone else pointed out though, the humidity of your environment does affect things. Dryer atmosphere means faster dry-out. 

For reference I am in a fairly dry city (\~20-30% avg humidity). So clearly Pilot is doing a good job designing those flaps. So far, never. This is after three or four years. The answer depends on your environment.  Do you live in an arid environment where evaporation happens quickly?  It may be a problem.  Do you live in a more humid environment where evaporation can take eternity?  No problem.

There may be some variation from pen to pen.  Also, the ink can make a difference - highly concentrated inks have less water to lose and evaporation quickly makes them decline to flow.  Private Reserve's Infinity line may help even more (I'm not sure on this, but since it's designed to support longer cap-off-and-idle time, it seems like it's designed to not evaporate quickly).

FWIW, I have two VPs (fine nib) and a Decimo (EF) and live in an arid environment (northern Utah) and while pens like the Jinhao x750/x450 and Waterman Kultur will show observable evaporation overnight, my VPs have not had that problem.  Note that I use them every day when inked.  I recommend against pigmented, glitter, high sheening, and otherwise concentrated inks.  Go with something that has water to lose - unless you're in an environment where the air is nearly saturated with water, in which case, use whatever ink you like. :) I have a fine VP. I leave it inked, but the nib retracted all the time. Writes fine. If I leave the nib out, it will dry quickly (like don't leave for a lunch with it open on your desk). It will start writing again.   
I do use pilot ink in it at this time. I wouldn't use any shimmer ink in it. 

  
The only time I couldn't get it to write, it had no ink left in the cartridge and I had left it for more than 6 months that way. Had to flush out the nib, but it works great. Mine is several weeks old and it hasn't dried out yet. It's my new favorite pen. Bad news for my other inked pens. Highly recommend the Doodlebud YT video covering this subject. I generally have 8-10 pens inked, and I keep them upright in a cup (in pen sleeves). Because they are nib up my 2 Decimos generally will evaporate a bit (ink is darker right at first), and this winter I needed to dip them in water to get them to write right away. However, if I leave them lying horizontally they start immediately with minimal dry out. I'd rather keep them nib up because anything lying on my desk is at a risk of being knocked onto the floor! I have an EF w/Namiki Black. Goes months without use, and has never dried out. My Decimo was inked two months ago, do not use it daily and it writes every time. Ink starts out slightly darker when I write with it. The vanishing point is prone to ink drying in the trap door which causes it to not seal all the way and making the nib too dry. Clean out the trap door by (1) soaking it while holding the trap door open with a toothpick or paperclip or (2) repeatedly spraying water. 

You will need to do this from time to time depending on how you fill the pen. It's best to take the nib out and not dip the whole pen in as this causes more ink to get inside. I thought that dipping the whole pen + nib in ink would make it more wet since this wets the fins of normal pens but this actually causes ink to dry and prevent a proper seal in the closed position (since the VP doesn't have a cap, the trap door is essentially what keeps it capped).

Found it out from this thread and it worked on my vanishing point that I thought was just too dry. Writes wetter than my Parker 51 now. https://old.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/k8k24k/help_vanishing_point_dries_up_after_a_day_of_not/gezpggg/ It‚Äôs my every day pen so it does not go long amounts of time without being used. But I‚Äôve gone on trips and left it inked at home. Not a hint of dry after even three to five days. I find some of my screw cap pens will. The only other ones I have that do not are a twsbi eco and a Kaweco sport al. I find the vanishing point more impressive in most regards than I expected going in.

The production was limited to 2014 pens. Look carefully at the rings between the cap and the base, the pen will be individually numbered xxxx/2014.

Why wait So you have two keepers. Congrats, and congrats. That‚Äôs cool!!  Great job fianc√©. Beautiful!!! So pretty!! Oooooh that‚Äôs pretty. I love the color. Wow that‚Äôs such a nice colour That fianc√© is a keeper! What a wonderful gift. 

  
I have a grey one, Christmas gift from my husband. It had a fine nib, but it turns out I'm not a fine nib lover. He had a medium nib which he didn't like, so we changed nibs and now we both happy. It writes s√≥ smooth. I should use it again when my Wancher is empty. 
Congrats!  The Pilot VP/Capless are great pens.  The VP is surprisingly very comfortable for lecture notes!  I have two VPs inked up as EDC pens.

Consider the following‚Ä¶
1. The converter (Con 40) sucks. Use a blunt tip syringe to refill the Pilot/Namaki cartridge.  

2.  The  VP nub unit likes straight wet inks.. due to its size stay away from foo foo glitter- pigment inks, these inks will gum up the nib unit and can be a pain to clean.  The following inks work very well: Pilot, Namiki,  Iroshizuku, and Diamine inks.

3. Consider a nice soft pen sleeve for VP LE pen.  A sleeve provides  extra protection to the finish. 

Congrats! Very cool! Wow!! Wonderful gift! Beautiful And *ahem* is there any chance I could steal your fianc√©? Pretty please? He is a keeper! ?üòÅ

Ohhh, I'm jealous. Idk if my partner would ever think of something that thoughtful or nice. Congrats!! Fantastic! Enjoy them both!! Pretty sure everyone here also just fell in love with your fianc√©. Congrats on finding a good one. ; ) You should sign the wedding license with it!!! Congratulations, he‚Äôs a keeper!!! wahoo! a very sleek and sexy one!

(I'm guessing at least one kiss was involved!) Your fianc√© is a keeper Very nice pen, i have one gifted to me by my father, i used tsuyu-kusa iroshizuku ink on it but now i got some J Herbin Bleu Myosotis that pairs amazing with this pen! Take care of it, very good pen imo A couple of years ago I bought a bottle of Tsukushi that i have been saving for a special pen, I think this will be it! Making plans as we speak. :D Agree! So lucky. :) Thanks for all the great advice! I already filled the Con-40 with a syringe, but if I am going to be filling it that way I'm thinking of maybe switching to a cartridge, maybe that way I'll a tiny bit more ink and I'll get to use the fancy cartridge cover that came with the pen. 

I just filled it with Iroshizuku Tsukushi, by the way, I was saving that bottle for a special occasion; but noted, I'll probably stay with Pilot inks with this one. :)  
  
I am already sketching a new notebook cover/pen case that I'll try to sew together, hopefully it will do justice to the pen. If I didn't already have a wife who has stood by me for almost 50 years, and followed me all over the world, I would be tempted, too. Thanks! Loving it so far! Came here to say this I‚Äôve been loving it! I want to use it as an EDC with my pocket journal, although I am a bit nervous about carrying it everywhere. But, again, I just love using it! That's the spirit you can sign your marriage certificate with this pen too I believe that pens are tools that are meant to be used.  Well cared for, but meant to be used. Get a single pen case for it, use it, take care of it, love it.  Most of all remember the gift, and make more memories with it. That‚Äôd would be lovely, but we already have a couple of matching E95s pens pre assigned for that. :) Thank you very much for that, I completely agree with the idea that pens are meant to be used!

I‚Äôve decided to carry it with me almost everywhere, though not in a single pen case, since I‚Äôm still a little bit worried about misplacing it. I‚Äôll keep it in a leather five-slot pen case that also has space for an A5 notebook, just finished sewing it! It‚Äôs designed to fit into a compact bag that serves as my bullet journal setup. Hopefully that way it‚Äôll still be somewhat portable, just not on its own.

By the way, I also carry a Field Notes‚Äìsized case with a couple of pens that I bring absolutely everywhere in my jeans‚Äô back pocket.

We both use Pilot Metropolitans and Kak√ºnos as our EDCs, mine date all the way back to 2016, this was a total shock! It is a 2014 ‚ÄúCopper‚Äù limited edition.  The production was limited to 2014 pens. Look carefully at the rings between the cap and the base, the pen will be individually numbered xxxx/2014.  There are several Pilot Iroshizuku Inks that pair well with this pen. Gorgeous!!! This one is on my list ‚Äî way to go, fianc√©! ‚ô•Ô∏è Marry him, like go to vegas
Why wait So you have two keepers. Congrats, and congrats. That‚Äôs cool!!  Great job fianc√©. Beautiful!!! So pretty!! Oooooh that‚Äôs pretty. I love the color. Wow that‚Äôs such a nice colour That fianc√© is a keeper! What a wonderful gift. 

  
I have a grey one, Christmas gift from my husband. It had a fine nib, but it turns out I'm not a fine nib lover. He had a medium nib which he didn't like, so we changed nibs and now we both happy. It writes s√≥ smooth. I should use it again when my Wancher is empty. 
Congrats!  The Pilot VP/Capless are great pens.  The VP is surprisingly very comfortable for lecture notes!  I have two VPs inked up as EDC pens.

Consider the following‚Ä¶
1. The converter (Con 40) sucks. Use a blunt tip syringe to refill the Pilot/Namaki cartridge.  

2.  The  VP nub unit likes straight wet inks.. due to its size stay away from foo foo glitter- pigment inks, these inks will gum up the nib unit and can be a pain to clean.  The following inks work very well: Pilot, Namiki,  Iroshizuku, and Diamine inks.

3. Consider a nice soft pen sleeve for VP LE pen.  A sleeve provides  extra protection to the finish. 

Congrats! Very cool! Wow!! Wonderful gift! Beautiful And *ahem* is there any chance I could steal your fianc√©? Pretty please? He is a keeper! ?üòÅ
I have a special edition with a similar box but Coral Red. Really pretty and great pens! ?üòç?ü§© WELCOME TO THE VANISHING POINT CLUB Your fianc√© is a keeper. Nice! They‚Äôre a keeper‚Ä¶. The pen, and the finance! ?üñãÔ∏è?üíç Congratulations on the achievement and the gift Wow! That is so Cool! Toooo cute! Well done?ü•≥?ü•≥ That's a beautiful looking pen. Congratulations! Ohhh, I'm jealous. Idk if my partner would ever think of something that thoughtful or nice. Congrats!! Fantastic! Enjoy them both!! Pretty sure everyone here also just fell in love with your fianc√©. Congrats on finding a good one. ; ) You should sign the wedding license with it!!! Congratulations, he‚Äôs a keeper!!! wahoo! a very sleek and sexy one!

(I'm guessing at least one kiss was involved!) Your fianc√© is a keeper Very nice pen, i have one gifted to me by my father, i used tsuyu-kusa iroshizuku ink on it but now i got some J Herbin Bleu Myosotis that pairs amazing with this pen! Take care of it, very good pen imo A couple of years ago I bought a bottle of Tsukushi that i have been saving for a special pen, I think this will be it! Making plans as we speak. :D Agree! So lucky. :) Thanks for all the great advice! I already filled the Con-40 with a syringe, but if I am going to be filling it that way I'm thinking of maybe switching to a cartridge, maybe that way I'll a tiny bit more ink and I'll get to use the fancy cartridge cover that came with the pen. 

I just filled it with Iroshizuku Tsukushi, by the way, I was saving that bottle for a special occasion; but noted, I'll probably stay with Pilot inks with this one. :)  
  
I am already sketching a new notebook cover/pen case that I'll try to sew together, hopefully it will do justice to the pen. If I didn't already have a wife who has stood by me for almost 50 years, and followed me all over the world, I would be tempted, too. Thanks! Loving it so far! Came here to say this I‚Äôve been loving it! I want to use it as an EDC with my pocket journal, although I am a bit nervous about carrying it everywhere. But, again, I just love using it! That's the spirit you can sign your marriage certificate with this pen too I believe that pens are tools that are meant to be used.  Well cared for, but meant to be used. Get a single pen case for it, use it, take care of it, love it.  Most of all remember the gift, and make more memories with it. That‚Äôd would be lovely, but we already have a couple of matching E95s pens pre assigned for that. :) Thank you very much for that, I completely agree with the idea that pens are meant to be used!

I‚Äôve decided to carry it with me almost everywhere, though not in a single pen case, since I‚Äôm still a little bit worried about misplacing it. I‚Äôll keep it in a leather five-slot pen case that also has space for an A5 notebook, just finished sewing it! It‚Äôs designed to fit into a compact bag that serves as my bullet journal setup. Hopefully that way it‚Äôll still be somewhat portable, just not on its own.

By the way, I also carry a Field Notes‚Äìsized case with a couple of pens that I bring absolutely everywhere in my jeans‚Äô back pocket. But I‚Äôm usually pretty rough with that one.";;
[Update] Boss Borrowed Vanishing Point While I was Out of the Office...;"A little while back, I posted about my boss, who borrowed a Vanishing Point off my desk at work while I was out of the office, then bought himself the Namiki Raden (Water) version of the pen because he loved mine so much...  


Well, we now have Fountain Pen friendly notepads, and a few bottles of ink available in the stock closet, AND I got to borrow the ridiculously gorgeous Raden Pen twice, for meetings with Clients! Man that thing just FEELS extravagant in the hand!  


He also left a bottle of the Pilot Yama-Budo Iroshisuku Glory Vine (my favorite ink) on my desk with my Pen all cleaned and inked up for me!   


Sufficed to say, this was truly a Happy Ending. A ""borrowed without permission"" tale that didn't end with a broken Nib and assault charges! Instead we got a freshly ""Pen-abled"" fan, with access to the Office Supply budget! =P";"This is NOT the post I expected from the title. What an excellent outcome! Congrats on creating another convert! Thank you for the update! I enjoyed your original post and it‚Äôs a treat to learn what your boss has been up to since buying the Raden. OP has penabled Boss *in absentia*. That is quite something! ONE OF US! ONE OF US! Is your office hiring I want to be in an FP friendly workplace too ?ü§£

Srsly though this next update is just beautiful. If only all accidental pen borrrowings went this route instead of the other route lol. <<group exhale>> ‚Ä¶ and a calm came over the fountain pen community far and wide. Amazing! I keep trying to hook people at work but no luck yet. That's awesome, not too many places adopt that stuff for the costs of fountain pen friendly paper and stuff. Read the headline thought ‚ÄúUh oh, goodbye Vanishing Point‚Äù. Read more and that‚Äôs pretty cool. He should buy you a Namiki for introducing them to him. This was a rollercoaster of emotions. First I missed the sub and thought you meant like a DVD then suddenly the real stakes became apparent and terrifying and finally it's all ok and we can live happily ever after. Nice. Congrats on one of the better stories. He really is a good person. I wish I had a boss like that. Remember your story and love reading the update. So lovely to have fountain pen friendly paper and ink around ;)) You are the OG pen daddy of the office! Go you! Awesome update! I remember your original post so was curious to read this!! Is he in here yet? And what a dream In this group this is like a perfect Christmas movie, screw romance, this is the kind of sappy happy ending we want! Your boss has good taste. My boss just goes‚Ä¶err ppl still use fountain pens?! ?üòÖ Your boss is just too cool! And what an awesome gesture with inking your pen for you. This post absolutely started my day on a high note! How are you comfortable taking a pen that expensive to work?! If I got my hands on a vanishing point, it would never leave my home desk. Yay we got a new update!! And it‚Äôs amazing!!! I love that your boss is so excited AND spreading the joy in the form of office supplies. And bottles of Yama-Budo ?ü§© <wishes we could still give awards> Having not seen your previous post, I saw the title of this one and expected tragedy! Whew, I am relieved to see a happy ending instead of a tragic tale of a mangled Vanishing Point. :) Good for the Holiday spirit.

I also just picked up some Yama-Budo for myself to try for the first time! So glad your boss got penabled, and didn‚Äôt break your pen (which is what I expected from the title, ngl). I assume he returned the VP? What FP notepads are you guys using? I‚Äôm trying to lay off of my iPad/Apple Pencil for work meeting notes, but need to find a good ink/paper combo that also dries relatively quickly. Love this update so much!! Well that worked out very well. Congratulations! I‚Äôm so glad you got to use the fancy pen! Took a screen shot of this post, all new to me and must know more Great update! I am the one who suggested you to borrow his pen. I figured out of all the subs I'm in, this one likes updates the most! 

It's really cool having yet another fountain pen user at work, now that makes 3 of us. One of my other co workers has been using them for a while, his favorite is a little brass Kaweco with the most sharp nib I've ever seen! 

My boss and I are both Medium nib users, preferring the thicker, juicier linework and silky smooth feel! Yes‚Ä¶ one of us! Pen addicts together strong! One of us! One of us! One of us!

Then I showed her my Risckshaw pen sleeves. We're a small company, 18 people. He's the owner, so he can buy whatever he wants ?üòÇ In my case it‚Äôs, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt use your your fancy pen.‚Äù (Not fancy my work pen is a $12 Etsy find) and ‚ÄúHow do I even use this?‚Äù Hoping to upgrade my daily soon. I'm actually new(ish) to the hobby and am still a bit nervous with inking pens from bottles, he's even newer but Youtubed how to, and did it for me as a bit of a thanks xD

I typically just buy cartridges, but I'm getting less anxious about inking. I take all my pens to work - fairly small company, I trust everyone. Never had an issue. My attitude is that pens are meant to be used, not babyed over - besides most don't know their value. I'm both fortunate enough to afford it, which I'm super grateful for, and also of the belief that an expensive pen is still a pen, and that price won't stop me from getting my money's worth. 

This pen lives in two places. My desk at work or my pocket. I use it as my every day pen. ‚Ä¶googles Namiki Raden‚Ä¶?üòÆ

Writing with flow, and with ease. Lol honestly I have been getting way too much attention lately in that department. One of my employees likes to try out my pens, but most just admire from a distance! That totally tracks. Actually all of my, ""pen-pals,"" at work *are* in IT, but none of them are new converts! I did bring in a bunch of cheap pens a couple years ago for people to try but they have been lost to time/turnover. I should get a handful of preppies and do that again. I get a lot of people gushing over my notebooks and asking about my pens too, but it usually ends there. One person recently said they inherited a bunch of old pens from their dad and that they should dig them out of storage, but no updates yet. I only see that person once every couple of months for a specific project meeting. Ahh gotcha that makes sense. This is my stance as well, with anything that is both quality, and expensive. I bought it to use it, and in this case. My Vanishing Point is my daily use pen. It stays in my pocket most of the time, or on my desk at work the rest of the time. 

Plus, the company is small, so I can always find the culprit if a pen goes missing. They'll come back with ink on their fingers, or saying, ""I don't know how to use this thing"" I'm new to the world of fountain pens. A beginner if you will. Literally getting my first one tomorrow.
 Seeing just how expensive some pens can get it's kind of crazy. Of course a pen should be used and not babied. I'm just a really cautious person. laughs in flea markets

Nice find. Tried to get one that was on eBay a couple weeks ago. It was a US market Namiki branded one. It included the box and paperwork and it was even a broad nib. It ended up selling for $500. I‚Äôm not jealous at all!

Excellent find :) That‚Äôs awesome, congrats on the great find! I love the faceted version of the VP and wish pilot would bring that back some day..

Me rn. God, this must be fate, especially after I recently made a post complain about how fast my Jinhao 10 Press dries out. Great find If this pen becomes your daily user, watch for wear on the high points that lose the matte black finish. That was the complaint about this model when that generation of VPs were still in the stores. Wow!  I‚Äôd go back to that shop.  I might even bring them coffee and pastries to strike up a conversation.  You never know.  They may have more in a box that they haven‚Äôt put out yet. Excellent find, congratulations. WOW!!  I lived in Zurich for 2 years.  That's unbelievable!  A Big Mac costs 15‚Ç¨. Amazing find! It's gorgeous, only a tiny bit envious ?üòâ Nice! I had a similar find. Was at an estate sale and got a box of  25 fountain pens for $25 and the glossy one was one of them. Among several other special ones. Huh, I never knew Majohn's A2 was based on an older VP design. I will give 5¬£ or a fresh brand spanking new 500‚Çπ indian note fresh form the atm for that I can only dream of a find like this. Congratulations, and I hope you enjoy it! I'd be thrilled to find pens in my local charity shops... at any price. Name of the shop? I‚Äôll probably be in Zurich in the near future and would love to check it out, regardless of whether I find a bargain or not. Adding to the pile of jealous congratulations.  Seriously a great find! 

I have one just like it that is my personal grail pen.  It‚Äôs my second time owning the black VP.  First one was stolen along with about half my pen collection when my house was burglarized about a dozen years ago.  That was a painful loss.  For years I tried to find a replacement, then on a business trip to Washington D.C, I popped into Fahrney‚Äôs where I bought the original (mail order) just to see the store in person for the first time.  In chatting with their in-house nib-meister, I told him my tale of woe, and he pulled out from his vest pocket (only a nib-meister..) an all black VP <F> and sold it to me on the spot.  It felt amazing to make that connection with somebody who was willing to part with such a unique pen to make a stranger‚Äôs day.  (He told me later he has a few more of the same at home) 

I hope you treasure your classic VP: they‚Äôre spectacular and elegant pens with no equal. Great find! Enjoy your new pen ¬†/u/inktation inspiration for this afternoon? Seriously, what a find, and that for a euro! Congrats I gotta be honest, I‚Äòd also pay muh much more for it haha. Just out of curiosity how much would that one cost you usually? The Namiki branded is even more rare I believe! Ho ho that‚Äôs a little crazy. I have one in excellent condition and it looks extra awesome with the modern black 18K nib. I‚Äòd too be jealous haha! I‚Äôll honor this pen :) Yeah me too, also that the clip is integrated into the tip makes it quite smooth imo. This one worked with a dried out cartridge which I spat into to try it haha‚Ä¶  And it works ever since! Yeah I would go back to Switzerland just for that shop‚Ä¶ It was for real, just in a huge box with a bunch of trashy crayons and dried out sharpies‚Ä¶ Such a lucky find for real‚Ä¶ it was one of the ‚Ä?Brockenhaus‚Äú. Can‚Äôt actually remember the exact location. 
Just try to find the ones where there is a lot of junk haha theres diamonds in them! :)) thankss! I feel like this could happen to anyone tho‚Ä¶ Prices of sold lots on eBay are between 185‚Ç¨ and 479‚Ç¨. 

I guess the are not as popular nowadays when you can get Moonman A2 for much less (a pretty close copy). Holy smokes, that‚Äôs a great hack ahh wow yeah that‚Äôs quite pricey but considering the rarity of it it‚Äòs ok. Thanks for the information! The moonman, and even the newer pilot pens, don't have that sleek/streamlined look.

I have the non-matte version. ofc since then I have thoroughly cleaned the pen and put a new cartrige in. Have been servicing it on a weekly basis to maintain the good shape it's in. I think the big part of sleekness is the clip shape. Moonman does not have it, nor the newer pilot pens. This integrated clip was only used on Myu and this faceted vanishing point. Awesome!! That‚Äôs good to hear. Exactly. It's the way the clip and the cone piece are integrated.";317;https://i.redd.it/xz9w1klhkp4e1.jpeg;fountainpens;"Found this in a random charity shop in Zurich (Pilot Vanishing Point Matte Black 1990)  On further inspection I noticed it is quite a rare find.

I might even bring them coffee and pastries to strike up a conversation.  You never know.  They may have more in a box that they haven‚Äôt put out yet. Excellent find, congratulations. WOW!!  I lived in Zurich for 2 years.  That's unbelievable!  A Big Mac costs 15‚Ç¨. Amazing find! It's gorgeous, only a tiny bit envious ?üòâ Nice! I had a similar find. Was at an estate sale and got a box of  25 fountain pens for $25 and the glossy one was one of them. Among several other special ones. Huh, I never knew Majohn's A2 was based on an older VP design. I will give 5¬£ or a fresh brand spanking new 500‚Çπ indian note fresh form the atm for that I can only dream of a find like this. Congratulations, and I hope you enjoy it! I'd be thrilled to find pens in my local charity shops... at any price. Name of the shop? I‚Äôll probably be in Zurich in the near future and would love to check it out, regardless of whether I find a bargain or not. Adding to the pile of jealous congratulations.  Seriously a great find! 

I have one just like it that is my personal grail pen.  It‚Äôs my second time owning the black VP.  First one was stolen along with about half my pen collection when my house was burglarized about a dozen years ago.  That was a painful loss.  For years I tried to find a replacement, then on a business trip to Washington D.C, I popped into Fahrney‚Äôs where I bought the original (mail order) just to see the store in person for the first time.  In chatting with their in-house nib-meister, I told him my tale of woe, and he pulled out from his vest pocket (only a nib-meister..) an all black VP <F> and sold it to me on the spot.  It felt amazing to make that connection with somebody who was willing to part with such a unique pen to make a stranger‚Äôs day.  (He told me later he has a few more of the same at home) 

I hope you treasure your classic VP: they‚Äôre spectacular and elegant pens with no equal. Great find! Enjoy your new pen ¬†/u/inktation inspiration for this afternoon? Seriously, what a find, and that for a euro! Congrats I gotta be honest, I‚Äòd also pay muh much more for it haha. Just out of curiosity how much would that one cost you usually? The Namiki branded is even more rare I believe! Ho ho that‚Äôs a little crazy. I have one in excellent condition and it looks extra awesome with the modern black 18K nib. I‚Äòd too be jealous haha! I‚Äôll honor this pen :) Yeah me too, also that the clip is integrated into the tip makes it quite smooth imo. This one worked with a dried out cartridge which I spat into to try it haha‚Ä¶  And it works ever since! Yeah I would go back to Switzerland just for that shop‚Ä¶ It was for real, just in a huge box with a bunch of trashy crayons and dried out sharpies‚Ä¶ Such a lucky find for real‚Ä¶ it was one of the ‚Ä?Brockenhaus‚Äú. Can‚Äôt actually remember the exact location. 
Just try to find the ones where there is a lot of junk haha theres diamonds in them! :)) thankss! I feel like this could happen to anyone tho‚Ä¶ Prices of sold lots on eBay are between 185‚Ç¨ and 479‚Ç¨. 

I guess the are not as popular nowadays when you can get Moonman A2 for much less (a pretty close copy). Holy smokes, that‚Äôs a great hack ahh wow yeah that‚Äôs quite pricey but considering the rarity of it it‚Äòs ok. Thanks for the information! The moonman, and even the newer pilot pens, don't have that sleek/streamlined look.

I have the non-matte version. ofc since then I have thoroughly cleaned the pen and put a new cartrige in. Have been servicing it on a weekly basis to maintain the good shape it's in. I think the big part of sleekness is the clip shape. Moonman does not have it, nor the newer pilot pens. This integrated clip was only used on Myu and this faceted vanishing point. Awesome!! That‚Äôs good to hear. Exactly. It's the way the clip and the cone piece are integrated.";;
Is the Pilot Vanishing Point THAT much better than the Majhon/MoonMan A1? ;;"Body? Similar. (Although the VP finish seems to be at least slightly higher quality. Both my A1s had the finish peel off in flakes after some very small scratches.)

Nib? Completely different writing feel. 

The A1 is a very stiff nib, with typically slightly-dry flow out of the box. Seems to be reliably smooth. In contrast, the VP nib is quite a bouncy/soft gold nib with more generous flow, especially at larger sizes. One of the buttery-smoothest nibs out there, especially at larger sizes. OTOH, their EF is one of the better UEFs you can get.

I'd say the A1 is more than sufficient if you just want a technical writing tool for school notes or something. But if you want a Nice Writing Experience, the VP is in a different league for sure. Depends on what you're looking for.

No frills, reliable writer, with an economical flow? Get the A1.

If you need to have that luscious nib feel, then it's the VP. I find the body of the VP to be more durable and had a better quality 'feel', though only slightly.  The nib on the Vanishing Point is a million times better.

I DID have a problem with the A1 'dripping' out the cap when stored sideways as well.  I think the little door on the A1 isn't as good at sealing.  It would sometimes be a slow starter because of it.  My VP on the other hand didn't dry out after ~10 years of non-use (it stayed in a drawer for a while), despite being pretty beat up after years of pocket duty. The VP is much better. The Majohn is pretty nice but it doesn‚Äôt write quite as nicely as the VP which feels better in the hand as well. Also, I can use iron gall in my VP but the Majohn I had was destroyed. Iron gall ink is all I use really.

If you‚Äôre not using iron gall the Majohn is very nice for the money. While ""better"" doesn't mean anything specific, I would say VP is better quality pen:

- body is much more resistant to wear, my A1 become scratched and oxidised after just few months while VP still looking good after a few years
- nib quality is more consistent on VP. I have A1 and A2 and both nib units leaking ink and generally getting dirty, while that's not an issue on VP
- VP has softer bouncer and smoother nib (even special alloy one) while A1 is basically a nail. I have an A1 with a Pilot VP nib! I got a really good deal on a used Matte Black VP ($100). I can‚Äôt stand the VP clip position, so instead of trying to rip it off, I got the clipless A1, swapped the nibs and re-sold just body of the VP (for $50). I‚Äôm very happy with the result, it‚Äôs a great workhorse pen. Also the QC is different. I have 3 majhon. 1 writes all the time , 1 dries out overnight,  the 3rd can be great then have flow problems then be fine after a light dip in water. The VP‚Äôs I have seen to be more reliable overall. YMMV I have both, and the VP is my favorite pen out of my entire collection, hands down.

But I've had the opposite problem from most people here with my A1. Mine just gushes ink even as an EF nib. It bleeds and feathers on paper I've never had issues with before (old Tomoe). Part of it might be the ink, but I'm still testing.

Like others have said, quality control is just different. Depends on what you are looking for if it will work for you. Yes. My A1 dries out within a day, which is annoying. I fancy a VP because I expect that they close tighter than my A1.
Can someone report? I just don't like the nib on my A2. It has an inconsistent flow.¬† I have an A1 but do not have a VP. What I will say is probably better quality control. My Moonman A1 is a fine (if kind of boring) writer, but it has a bunch of random glue residue near the joint where the pen unscrews.

Not really enough to be visible unless you look closely, but I am kind of anal retentive about these types of things when it comes to new pens. The finish doesn't feel durable. I can't imagine a Pilot would have the same issue.

Still, I am pretty happy with the pen and think it's a killer deal, particularly now. I got mine when it was like $35. I do want to get a Pilot Decimo at some point though - the A1 is a little too heavy for me so I don't think I want a VP. I got a Majohn A1 and it only came in EF, but it was like writing with a needle, so horrible. I used some micro mesh and separated the tines a little and it writes a lot nicer now, but still nowhere near the smoothness of my pilot capless.

Just from your writing it looks like yours might be ok, is it scratchy at all? Mine was literally tearing the paper. Tbh if mine was smooth when I first got it, I may have not gone on to get the capless, but I'm glad I did as gold nib pens just feel so smooth.

The body is pretty much an exact copy with some small finishing issues. I haven‚Äôt gotten an A1, I don‚Äôt enjoy the body on the A2, it‚Äôs plastic. I do enjoy a VP but the $$$ is outta my league. I heard the A1 has a metal body so that‚Äôs my next buy. This last A2 I got is better than the first one I got . So maybe I got a bum but this new one is better than the VPs I have. So I‚Äôd say drive the Majohns first before getting  a vanishing point I think the question isn't about whether one is objectively better than the other, in terms of build quality/fit and finish and mechanical durability, the VP has a proven track record going back decades. But at the same time, it's not for everyone. It's not a cheap pen and the placement of the clip doesn't work for a lot of people. So something like the A1 (or A2 if you're comparing the Decimo) can be a handy way to check whether the size, shape and clip placement work for you before you commit to the VP.

If I were looking for an everyday writer with a fairly reliable nib for single-handed operation, I'd get the A1. It's just that I've got a few TWSBIs awaiting their turn to be brought to use first. Moonman have a decent track record with nibs, and I won't be too crushed if the A1 packs it in a few years either.

Is the Capless worth 4 times as much as an A1 though? That depends on what you value.  The nibs on both of mine are amazing, and they are mechanically very robust and durable. They are long lasting pens and my in-use VP is like a pair with my Lamy 2000 as my go-everywhere always inked pens.

  
One big catch is the A1 only seems to be avaialble with EF nibs. So that might limit the usefulness of the pen if that nib size isn't for you (certainly isn't for me) Yes. Quality and consistency. 
Quality body resistant to wear
Consistency in nibs
Nib is bouncy and more nib sizes available 
Nothing is smoother than a pilot nib
Pilot doesn't dry out

Love my capless and decimos. They are a very reliable joyful writing experience. Yes. Maybe not, but I‚Äôd much rather pay the innovator rather than the leeches. I do have Asvine pens that mimic the 823, but I got those after buying 3 of the Pilots.¬† I was just looking at this on Amazon and thought about getting it. It‚Äôs weird because all of them have only like 3 star reviews but whenever I see someone write with they say the complete opposite. I‚Äôm honestly on the fence‚Ä¶ The A1 is a solid writer, if a bit dry. I've taken to storing mine tip-down so that it writes first try when I pick it up after a few days. The one thing it \*doesn't\* do that my VPs did was seep ink all over the inside of the pen body when not in use, so there's another plus. Yes. No, not really. Especially when you can buy a gold nib unit for $90 and a majohn pen ""body"" for $30 Nope

I have owned 2 VPs and 3 A1s.  The only difference is that the VP doesn't dry out as fast and the A1 has better styling vs. Pilot's basic line I‚Äôve never tried the VP but using the A1 tires my hands and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs due to the weight and clip which would mean the VP will have the same issue.
If so, I personally don‚Äôt feel like VP is worth the price and A1 serves me well as a work pen that I clip to my a6 tomoe notebook.

That said, I am hoping to visit a store in Japan that might be able to let me sample a VP in F to see if my opinions can be changed but personally I‚Äôm eyeing a Mont Blanc noblesse in the same price range if I were to ever replace my A1

My other setups are: For journaling I use a Mont Blanc 144 and for everyday notes and ideas, I keep an a7 tomoe river notebook with a pilot elite in my wallet I was astonished by the majohn A1, I purchased and tried the pilot steel nib and the rhodium-plated gold nib and actually ended up preferring the majohn A1 and the pilot gold nib, almost same level

Sometimes I wrote for hours without noticing I was actually using the cheap 15‚Ç¨ majohn nib, instead of the pilot gold one The body, no. The nib, probably yes. So a A1 body and VP nib is obviously the answer! Sounds like the ¬´Old Argument¬ª of quality. Do you want a pen that services you after 3, 5, 10‚Ä¶. years, or do you prefer to buy another whenever you need?

Of course there are times when a cheap is as good as the expensive and lasts a long, long time. I have a pilot VP with medium nib and I love it. Since I was curious, I bought an A1, A2 and A3. All three of the Majohns write well and have worked flawlessly for the few months I have owned them.

I found a guy on Etsy that sells stubs for the Majohn retractables. His name is Bobby and he is all over Etsy.

I bought a stub nib from him and it improved my enjoyment of the F or EFs of the Majohn. It‚Äôs not much of a difference in horizontal vs vertical, but just enough to see the difference in my cursive.

I still like the Pilot better, but I have improved my Majohn to be more enjoyable. I think the nib cost me $15 or so. I'm using the body of the Pilot capless Decimo with a MaJohn nib, Go figure. 

I must have received a wonky Pilot nib. I write at a normal slant, yet a part of the nib feels like it jams against the paper. This is during normal cursive. It's a shame. Yes Kinda, having tried both I can say the feel of the body is the same, I couldn't tell the difference, writing-wise idk, it depends. I like EF and the A1 only comes in EF, my A1 is smooth, and writes impressively well, the VP has many nib options, has a gold nib and its very consistent from what I've heard. I tried the Medium nib on the VP and it was nice,  idk how the other sizes compare Honestly, no. The 18k nib does feel different, but I prefer the steel. I sold my VP and use an A1 fine nib and it's perfect. Probaby my favorite pen Yes, the nib is much more satisfying to write with. No experienced fountain pen user would be fooled if you made them write with their eyes closed. No I agree. My A1 (matt black) developed ""stretch marks"" in lack of a better description on the push button and the color wore off rather quickly to reveal the metal body underneath. Thanks for the detailed response, I will stick to my A1 then, it has been great so far. Maybe I got lucky and got a good one. Mine is an actual MoonMan, so maybe it's old? IDK Anyone know what the nibfeel on the steel nib version of the vp is? 100% my experience. honestly have been really disappointed by my Pilot Capless; nib feels dry and as though the sweet spot is approximately two square microns in size¬†


this is weird bc all my Pilot experiences have been very positive! is the VP that much better? I'll stick to my A1 then, thanks! Honestly, the Mahjohn nibs are really nice. The Pilot is still better, but it's a shockingly small difference. My A1 has been flawless, which is why I was wondering if the VP was worth it. Maybe I got a good one? haha Thanks for the input, I will stick with my A1 then! Clip doesn't bug me, so a stock clipped A1 is fine for me. Sounds like you got the best of both worlds there! Hope you enjoy it! Forgot to say, my handwriting is very small, and the VP is the best pen I have for writing my normal script. The A1 is more like an F nib to me, so even if it was more consistent, I might not turn to it as often. My handwriting is small as well. So you feel the Pilot is actually finer than the A1? Interesting, might pick up just a nib unit. Or splurge and get a whole pen haha. Thanks for the input,  it was rather useful. This. Have both, use both. Same f‚Äôing problem. A1 doesn‚Äôt flow well at first when used daily, and needs wetting if not used for a few days. My VP can chill for months and writes fine. I‚Äôve cleaned it throughly fwiw and tried a few inks. Just doesn‚Äôt seal well. My A1 dried out really fast too. With the same ink that I use in my VP (Noodler's 54th Massachusetts). My VP can go a few weeks before drying out, the A1 barely survived a weekend without use. Well [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/s/t3PgIJMZJ9) below said it didn‚Äôt dry in ~10 years. That was not my experience, after forgetting a Decimo for about half a year, I had to reactivate it by dipping it in water. But a day?! No, it definitely stays good over a weekend. So I was having a feed issue with my A1 and ended up ordering a hand ground medium stub nib for it ($13 usd from Bobby pens on Amazon and Etsy) I got so frustrated that I over flexed the original EF nib and bent it a bit. After that it worked WAY more reliably. It‚Äôs been even better since I put the new nib on. My VP nib dries out after a few days. Huh, weird, my A1 has been flawless, which is why I was wondering about the VP, I have absolutely no complaints with my A1. Maybe they fixed it? I have several, and they're fine after months. I understand that I am relatively new to fountain pens, but my A1 seems fantastic. I can't imagine the Pilot being 4 times better. From what I gather from this whole thread is that I got lucky with my A1, never had a problem with it. Mine is great actually, which led me to this post, my A1 is already great, so why bother if the performance will be the same, or maybe just a small percentage better for a much bigger price. A1 does have a metal body, some say it is too heavy. I don't mind the weight. My A1 rocks, I guess I got lucky maybe? Price on the VP is a bit much for me as well, especially when you have no idea if you'd like it or not. That is my A1 in the picture, I love EF nibs, so it was a perfect match. I just can't fathom it is 4 times better like you said. I really like the A1, so will probably stick with it for the foreseeable future. Thanks for your input. I will stick to my A1 for now, but it sounds like I will inevitably end up with a Vanishing Point. Thanks for your input. Straight to the point ?üò? True, but money is an issue, so if my A1 is pretty much all I need, well maybe I don't need a VP. Well yet anyway, I'm sure I will inevitably get one haha. Which Asvine models mimic the 823, and how was your experience with them? Innovator might be a bit of a stretch, the VP came out in ‚Äò63. 

The 60ish years between the Pilot Vanishing point and the release of the Majohn A1 is an important detail here. Pilot has long since made the cost of R&D back as well as a handsome profit, not to mention from what I‚Äôve heard (but haven‚Äôt been able to substantiate yet) the patent for the Vanishing Point has expired. I have trouble feeling bad for the multi-million if not billion dollar company here. 

 I‚Äôd also make a wager that the people having to choose between the Vanishing Point and the A1 are an extremely small percentage of either pens sales. The fact that you could buy 4 A1 for the price of one Vanishing Point (average for the standard model, yes there are cheaper ones and way more expensive ones) puts them in different submarkets. Hell for me personally I like the Vanishing Point a ton, but the idea of spending that kind of money on a pen would be irresponsible and stupid for me. I got mine from eBay. Don't know if that would make a difference, but for the price I paid, which was like 28 ish USD, I love it and think it is a great value. It came with a bunch of accessories and converters and stuff. My A1 can go weeks without me using it. It writes maybe just a tad wet even. Maybe I got lucky with mine? I mean I think the stock nib is fine. I admit I may be newer to fountain pens, but I just don't see how the feel could be 4 times as good if you compare prices. I kinda figured, My A1 is fantastic. Cant fathom the VP being 4 times better when you compare it price wise. Sounds like you know what you like and have some experience! I am pretty new to fountain pens, but I do really enjoy writing with them! The 144 looks like a beautiful pen! Cherish it! Yeah, my A1 is great, which is why I made this post. I just can't fathom that the VP would be like 4 times better or whatever the math works out to price wise. At that point you‚Äôre at the cost of an OEM gray market VP though‚Ä¶ Interesting idea... Does the spring from your Majohn work on the Decimo? Fine nibs are available on AliExpress.  I bought one (two actually) and replaced the EF on my A2 I like EF as well, Thanks for the input, I will stick with my A1 then! I don't mind wear, actually kina like worn stuff. I bought a vanishing point Decimo a year ago. Out of the box, compete disappointment. Was already in the process of returning it. 

I tried cleaning it, drying it properly, swapping inks, everything. It wrote really poorly. Felt bad to use. One day I accidentally drop it on the nib on my hard floor. Since then, it writes flawlessly and things flow smoothly. Nib doesn‚Äôt look dented Better than the A1? I don‚Äôt know how to answer that.

I like writing with it more, sure. I‚Äôm also picky about how my pens write. What nib size do you have? Vanishing Point and Capless are different names used in different markets for the same pen. The VP is the Capless. Same pen. The VP is the Capless. Same pen. I have 3 A1s and 3 VPs, the diff is not that much. Enjoy! Where did you get your A1? My A1 and A2 dry out very quick, rendering them pretty useless. Fair enough. Yeah, I have a weird/non standard pen grip so I prefer the no clip, but I think the people who are bothered by the clip are the minority. I just like that Moonman offers both. If Pilot sold a no clip version, I‚Äôd definitely buy that. <EF> on both. Thicker nibs may not have as much of an issue. I've had my VPs stay wet for a couple months. Ten years is wild. ?üòÇ Well, that's fountain pens in general. You start getting diminishing returns after a certain point. A $60 pen isn't twice as good as a $30 pen, but it might have a more interesting filling system or made with a more interesting material. Or maybe better quality control. It's hard to quantify how much that's ""worth.""

Once you start getting into the >$100 mark you start seeing gold nibs, and those can definitely be more fun to write with than steel nibs (usually they're a little softer than steel nibs, but not always). But a well tuned steel nib will get you 99% of the way there if we're talking purely practical concerns.

That's kind of the nice thing about fountain pens IMO. You can spend to the moon and back if you want to and get some really cool unique pens, but you don't have to. A good $20-$30 pen will last you many many years. Very true. That's fair. Go with what your budget allows, and if you don't like the form factor, it was only like <insert current price of A1> lost and not, in some cases, hundreds. But I definitely recommend you get the real thing eventually. It's a beautiful pen.

The funny thing about the A1 is, that pen got me back into fountain pens. I saw it on amazon and was intrigued, did some digging and found it was a copy of my already beloved brand Pilot. I bought a Fermo instead, and am now swimming in pens again. I don't really feel bad for Pilot but I wish Moonman/Majohn was more innovative with their designs. Clearly their engineers and designers are very talented but they're using tried and true designs from other companies as a bit of a crutch.

I wonder if part of it is market demand. I have a few Moonman pens that are original designs (some of them are pretty cool IMO) and they're just not popular at all. I guess they're making what people want to buy, and what people want to buy are more affordable versions of popular expensive pens. Bit of a shame, personally.

I wouldn't mind so much if they cribbed some older designs that aren't in production anymore and made them popular again though. A new Snorkel maybe? That would be awesome. 

Or a new Myu-like (especially since Pilot won't make them again). I'd buy a $50 Majohn Myu-man in a heartbeat. I don't have it in me to spend $175 on a Pilot Myu and then be too afraid to use it because it's irreplaceable. It‚Äôs a pen sub, why are you criticising spending money on pens? You don‚Äôt have to buy it if you don‚Äôt want it.  Innovator isn‚Äôt a stretch, they invented it I probably just need to tune mine, and the ink I'm using is probably a bit of a drier ink. Storing it tip-down has helped considerably though. =D Oh that‚Äôs giving me too much credit, I was honestly just influenced by all the youtube reviews and just went like ‚Äúeh, worse case I‚Äôm out like $30‚Äù when deciding on A1. I tought so too, also my expectations while trying a montblanc or very expensive pens, luckily, majohn just outperforms in its field and the manufacturers didn't went lazy on the actual performances

Also, I would suggest you to try the 2024 version with a fine nib, it's just great True and then you may as well get it all VP, unless you prefer one of the A1 colors. I like the A2 better, myself. Totally worth it, especially if you can get your hands on a VP nib unit for cheap (second hand, discounted, transplanted, etc). I have a 10ish year old 1.1 Stub unit in a A2 and love it, the og body was beat to crap from daily pocket carry. It's lighter than the all brass units and still has a lovely writing feel. There's just a slight friction when using the MaJohn on my Decimo, if you could call it friction. I feel the resistance slightly harder on the clicker, therefore the spring feels tighter. It does not affect how the nib comes out of the pen barrel. That's nice, I didn't know, i might try one for my A2, I really hate how that one writes Then you will actually really like the A1. It looked like a treasured well used item in about six months of use. It didn't break, but just looked worn. I‚Äôve had my A1 for a few months now, no scratches.. I don‚Äôt use a pen pouch as it is my EDC my understanding was that the VP has a gold nib and the capless has an alloy nib, but the other features are equal I got it on eBay a while back. It is actually branded as MoonMan, which is the old company name I think, so maybe it was an older one? Not an expert, which is why I made this post haha. Yeah, mine is actually maybe a little on the wetter side, it takes a few for the ink to dry, but really feels about right. I love mine! Sorry about yours :( Thinking the same. I‚Äôd love to have enough great pens I could forget a VP ten years ?ü§© I agree that when moonman/majohn does something original it‚Äôs interesting at the very least, I think they do good tweaks on the pens they ‚Äúrip-off‚Äù. One of the biggest things I like about my own A1 that I‚Äôve never seen on a VP is a textured body. I love the look and feel of the fish scale body. I like the option of clip or clip-less. 

I think we all kind of forget that most of their products are meant for the internal Chinese market and less for international markets. I also think that it‚Äôs not the worst thing in the world to have a less expensive option, I‚Äôd feel much better spending $40 and thinking ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt for me‚Äô instead of $160 Where was I criticizing? Was it the sentence I started with ‚ÄúHell for me personally‚Äù and ended with ‚Äúfor me‚Äù? 

It was innovative a literal half century ago. In the intervening time people have been born, lived a fulfilling life and have died in the gap between when the Vanishing point released and when the A1 released. I‚Äôm not discounting their work on it, nor am I saying that they should stop making them or anything like that. I hope pilot takes people buying the A1/2/3 as a wake up call to do more. It‚Äôs competition, do you know who benefits from companies having to compete with each other? The consumer, us we win in that fight. There is the capless alloy nib on the Amazon pilot store too. $60-80?

A brief skim didn‚Äôt show any stubs though, so my wallet stayed closed. I also didn‚Äôt look too hard because I don‚Äôt need to be buying more pens, especially ones in ambivalent about‚Ä¶ Right‚Ä¶ Thanks for sharing!! ?ü§© The nibs slide off like a Lamy but it was pretty snug.  I used a dull knife blade to push it off the feed.  There‚Äôs little tabs on the back of the nib that you can push on Try using it in inverse. Since doing this my A2 has been my EDC.. I swapped the A2 nib into the A1 matte black body though. According to [this article](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2023/4/28/pilot-vanishing-pointcapless-fountain-pens-a-quick-comparison), the VP (sold outside Japan) always has a gold nib. The Capless (the name in Japan) has a gold nib, and can sometimes be found with an alloy nib (not sure if there is a specific name for it). oh huh, I didn't know that.¬† mine has the alloy nib and it is just not very good, which is atypical of pilot in my experience. I have an e95s and a prera and I absolutely love both. this capless is just not exactly the bomb and I don't know if it's fixable or not¬† You can buy a gold nib for it. That will set you back about $90-$100 though (while a whole pen is $170). You can take advantage of that to try a different nib size or style too if you wanted.";86;https://i.redd.it/2htvs9uhh4dd1.jpeg;fountainpens;"Is the Pilot Vanishing Point THAT much better than the Majhon/MoonMan A1?   Body? Similar. (Although the VP finish seems to be at least slightly higher quality. Both my A1s had the finish peel off in flakes after some very small scratches.)

Nib? Completely different writing feel. 

The A1 is a very stiff nib, with typically slightly-dry flow out of the box. Seems to be reliably smooth. In contrast, the VP nib is quite a bouncy/soft gold nib with more generous flow, especially at larger sizes. One of the buttery-smoothest nibs out there, especially at larger sizes. OTOH, their EF is one of the better UEFs you can get.

I'd say the A1 is more than sufficient if you just want a technical writing tool for school notes or something. But if you want a Nice Writing Experience, the VP is in a different league for sure. Depends on what you're looking for.

No frills, reliable writer, with an economical flow? Get the A1.

If you need to have that luscious nib feel, then it's the VP. I find the body of the VP to be more durable and had a better quality 'feel', though only slightly.  The nib on the Vanishing Point is a million times better.

I DID have a problem with the A1 'dripping' out the cap when stored sideways as well.  I think the little door on the A1 isn't as good at sealing.  It would sometimes be a slow starter because of it.  My VP on the other hand didn't dry out after ~10 years of non-use (it stayed in a drawer for a while), despite being pretty beat up after years of pocket duty. The VP is much better. The Majohn is pretty nice but it doesn‚Äôt write quite as nicely as the VP which feels better in the hand as well. Also, I can use iron gall in my VP but the Majohn I had was destroyed. Iron gall ink is all I use really.

If you‚Äôre not using iron gall the Majohn is very nice for the money. While ""better"" doesn't mean anything specific, I would say VP is better quality pen:

- body is much more resistant to wear, my A1 become scratched and oxidised after just few months while VP still looking good after a few years
- nib quality is more consistent on VP. I have A1 and A2 and both nib units leaking ink and generally getting dirty, while that's not an issue on VP
- VP has softer bouncer and smoother nib (even special alloy one) while A1 is basically a nail. I have an A1 with a Pilot VP nib! I got a really good deal on a used Matte Black VP ($100). I can‚Äôt stand the VP clip position, so instead of trying to rip it off, I got the clipless A1, swapped the nibs and re-sold just body of the VP (for $50). I‚Äôm very happy with the result, it‚Äôs a great workhorse pen. Also the QC is different. I have 3 majhon. 1 writes all the time , 1 dries out overnight,  the 3rd can be great then have flow problems then be fine after a light dip in water. The VP‚Äôs I have seen to be more reliable overall. YMMV I have both, and the VP is my favorite pen out of my entire collection, hands down.

But I've had the opposite problem from most people here with my A1. Mine just gushes ink even as an EF nib. It bleeds and feathers on paper I've never had issues with before (old Tomoe). Part of it might be the ink, but I'm still testing.

Like others have said, quality control is just different. Depends on what you are looking for if it will work for you. Yes. My A1 dries out within a day, which is annoying. I fancy a VP because I expect that they close tighter than my A1.
Can someone report? I just don't like the nib on my A2. It has an inconsistent flow.¬† I have an A1 but do not have a VP. What I will say is probably better quality control. My Moonman A1 is a fine (if kind of boring) writer, but it has a bunch of random glue residue near the joint where the pen unscrews.

Not really enough to be visible unless you look closely, but I am kind of anal retentive about these types of things when it comes to new pens. The finish doesn't feel durable. I can't imagine a Pilot would have the same issue.

Still, I am pretty happy with the pen and think it's a killer deal, particularly now. I got mine when it was like $35. I do want to get a Pilot Decimo at some point though - the A1 is a little too heavy for me so I don't think I want a VP. I got a Majohn A1 and it only came in EF, but it was like writing with a needle, so horrible. I used some micro mesh and separated the tines a little and it writes a lot nicer now, but still nowhere near the smoothness of my pilot capless.

Just from your writing it looks like yours might be ok, is it scratchy at all? Mine was literally tearing the paper. Tbh if mine was smooth when I first got it, I may have not gone on to get the capless, but I'm glad I did as gold nib pens just feel so smooth.

The body is pretty much an exact copy with some small finishing issues. I haven‚Äôt gotten an A1, I don‚Äôt enjoy the body on the A2, it‚Äôs plastic. I do enjoy a VP but the $$$ is outta my league. I heard the A1 has a metal body so that‚Äôs my next buy. This last A2 I got is better than the first one I got . So maybe I got a bum but this new one is better than the VPs I have. So I‚Äôd say drive the Majohns first before getting  a vanishing point I think the question isn't about whether one is objectively better than the other, in terms of build quality/fit and finish and mechanical durability, the VP has a proven track record going back decades. But at the same time, it's not for everyone. It's not a cheap pen and the placement of the clip doesn't work for a lot of people. So something like the A1 (or A2 if you're comparing the Decimo) can be a handy way to check whether the size, shape and clip placement work for you before you commit to the VP.

If I were looking for an everyday writer with a fairly reliable nib for single-handed operation, I'd get the A1. It's just that I've got a few TWSBIs awaiting their turn to be brought to use first. Moonman have a decent track record with nibs, and I won't be too crushed if the A1 packs it in a few years either.

Is the Capless worth 4 times as much as an A1 though? That depends on what you value.  The nibs on both of mine are amazing, and they are mechanically very robust and durable. They are long lasting pens and my in-use VP is like a pair with my Lamy 2000 as my go-everywhere always inked pens.

  
One big catch is the A1 only seems to be avaialble with EF nibs. So that might limit the usefulness of the pen if that nib size isn't for you (certainly isn't for me) Yes. Quality and consistency. 
Quality body resistant to wear
Consistency in nibs
Nib is bouncy and more nib sizes available 
Nothing is smoother than a pilot nib
Pilot doesn't dry out

Love my capless and decimos. They are a very reliable joyful writing experience. Yes. Maybe not, but I‚Äôd much rather pay the innovator rather than the leeches. I do have Asvine pens that mimic the 823, but I got those after buying 3 of the Pilots.¬† I was just looking at this on Amazon and thought about getting it. It‚Äôs weird because all of them have only like 3 star reviews but whenever I see someone write with they say the complete opposite. I‚Äôm honestly on the fence‚Ä¶ The A1 is a solid writer, if a bit dry. I've taken to storing mine tip-down so that it writes first try when I pick it up after a few days. The one thing it \*doesn't\* do that my VPs did was seep ink all over the inside of the pen body when not in use, so there's another plus. Yes. No, not really. Especially when you can buy a gold nib unit for $90 and a majohn pen ""body"" for $30 Nope

I have owned 2 VPs and 3 A1s.  The only difference is that the VP doesn't dry out as fast and the A1 has better styling vs. Pilot's basic line I‚Äôve never tried the VP but using the A1 tires my hands and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs due to the weight and clip which would mean the VP will have the same issue.
If so, I personally don‚Äôt feel like VP is worth the price and A1 serves me well as a work pen that I clip to my a6 tomoe notebook.

That said, I am hoping to visit a store in Japan that might be able to let me sample a VP in F to see if my opinions can be changed but personally I‚Äôm eyeing a Mont Blanc noblesse in the same price range if I were to ever replace my A1

My other setups are: For journaling I use a Mont Blanc 144 and for everyday notes and ideas, I keep an a7 tomoe river notebook with a pilot elite in my wallet I was astonished by the majohn A1, I purchased and tried the pilot steel nib and the rhodium-plated gold nib and actually ended up preferring the majohn A1 and the pilot gold nib, almost same level

Sometimes I wrote for hours without noticing I was actually using the cheap 15‚Ç¨ majohn nib, instead of the pilot gold one The body, no. The nib, probably yes. So a A1 body and VP nib is obviously the answer! Sounds like the ¬´Old Argument¬ª of quality. Do you want a pen that services you after 3, 5, 10‚Ä¶. years, or do you prefer to buy another whenever you need?

Of course there are times when a cheap is as good as the expensive and lasts a long, long time. I have a pilot VP with medium nib and I love it. Since I was curious, I bought an A1, A2 and A3. All three of the Majohns write well and have worked flawlessly for the few months I have owned them.

I found a guy on Etsy that sells stubs for the Majohn retractables. His name is Bobby and he is all over Etsy.

I bought a stub nib from him and it improved my enjoyment of the F or EFs of the Majohn. It‚Äôs not much of a difference in horizontal vs vertical, but just enough to see the difference in my cursive.

I still like the Pilot better, but I have improved my Majohn to be more enjoyable. I think the nib cost me $15 or so. I'm using the body of the Pilot capless Decimo with a MaJohn nib, Go figure. 

I must have received a wonky Pilot nib. I write at a normal slant, yet a part of the nib feels like it jams against the paper. This is during normal cursive. It's a shame. Yes Kinda, having tried both I can say the feel of the body is the same, I couldn't tell the difference, writing-wise idk, it depends. I like EF and the A1 only comes in EF, my A1 is smooth, and writes impressively well, the VP has many nib options, has a gold nib and its very consistent from what I've heard. I tried the Medium nib on the VP and it was nice,  idk how the other sizes compare Honestly, no. The 18k nib does feel different, but I prefer the steel. I sold my VP and use an A1 fine nib and it's perfect. Probaby my favorite pen Yes, the nib is much more satisfying to write with. No experienced fountain pen user would be fooled if you made them write with their eyes closed. No I agree. My A1 (matt black) developed ""stretch marks"" in lack of a better description on the push button and the color wore off rather quickly to reveal the metal body underneath. Thanks for the detailed response, I will stick to my A1 then, it has been great so far. Maybe I got lucky and got a good one. Mine is an actual MoonMan, so maybe it's old? IDK Anyone know what the nibfeel on the steel nib version of the vp is? 100% my experience. honestly have been really disappointed by my Pilot Capless; nib feels dry and as though the sweet spot is approximately two square microns in size¬†


this is weird bc all my Pilot experiences have been very positive! is the VP that much better? I'll stick to my A1 then, thanks! Honestly, the Mahjohn nibs are really nice. The Pilot is still better, but it's a shockingly small difference. My A1 has been flawless, which is why I was wondering if the VP was worth it. Maybe I got a good one? haha Thanks for the input, I will stick with my A1 then! Clip doesn't bug me, so a stock clipped A1 is fine for me. Sounds like you got the best of both worlds there! Hope you enjoy it! Forgot to say, my handwriting is very small, and the VP is the best pen I have for writing my normal script. The A1 is more like an F nib to me, so even if it was more consistent, I might not turn to it as often. My handwriting is small as well. So you feel the Pilot is actually finer than the A1? Interesting, might pick up just a nib unit. Or splurge and get a whole pen haha. Thanks for the input,  it was rather useful. This. Have both, use both. Same f‚Äôing problem. A1 doesn‚Äôt flow well at first when used daily, and needs wetting if not used for a few days. My VP can chill for months and writes fine. I‚Äôve cleaned it throughly fwiw and tried a few inks. Just doesn‚Äôt seal well. My A1 dried out really fast too. With the same ink that I use in my VP (Noodler's 54th Massachusetts). My VP can go a few weeks before drying out, the A1 barely survived a weekend without use. Well [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/s/t3PgIJMZJ9) below said it didn‚Äôt dry in ~10 years. That was not my experience, after forgetting a Decimo for about half a year, I had to reactivate it by dipping it in water. But a day?! No, it definitely stays good over a weekend. So I was having a feed issue with my A1 and ended up ordering a hand ground medium stub nib for it ($13 usd from Bobby pens on Amazon and Etsy) I got so frustrated that I over flexed the original EF nib and bent it a bit. After that it worked WAY more reliably. It‚Äôs been even better since I put the new nib on. My VP nib dries out after a few days. Huh, weird, my A1 has been flawless, which is why I was wondering about the VP, I have absolutely no complaints with my A1. Maybe they fixed it? I have several, and they're fine after months. I understand that I am relatively new to fountain pens, but my A1 seems fantastic. I can't imagine the Pilot being 4 times better. From what I gather from this whole thread is that I got lucky with my A1, never had a problem with it. Mine is great actually, which led me to this post, my A1 is already great, so why bother if the performance will be the same, or maybe just a small percentage better for a much bigger price. A1 does have a metal body, some say it is too heavy. I don't mind the weight. My A1 rocks, I guess I got lucky maybe? Price on the VP is a bit much for me as well, especially when you have no idea if you'd like it or not. That is my A1 in the picture, I love EF nibs, so it was a perfect match. I just can't fathom it is 4 times better like you said. I really like the A1, so will probably stick with it for the foreseeable future. Thanks for your input. I will stick to my A1 for now, but it sounds like I will inevitably end up with a Vanishing Point. Thanks for your input. Straight to the point ?üò? True, but money is an issue, so if my A1 is pretty much all I need, well maybe I don't need a VP. Well yet anyway, I'm sure I will inevitably get one haha. Which Asvine models mimic the 823, and how was your experience with them? Innovator might be a bit of a stretch, the VP came out in ‚Äò63. 

The 60ish years between the Pilot Vanishing point and the release of the Majohn A1 is an important detail here. Pilot has long since made the cost of R&D back as well as a handsome profit, not to mention from what I‚Äôve heard (but haven‚Äôt been able to substantiate yet) the patent for the Vanishing Point has expired. I have trouble feeling bad for the multi-million if not billion dollar company here. 

 I‚Äôd also make a wager that the people having to choose between the Vanishing Point and the A1 are an extremely small percentage of either pens sales. The fact that you could buy 4 A1 for the price of one Vanishing Point (average for the standard model, yes there are cheaper ones and way more expensive ones) puts them in different submarkets. Hell for me personally I like the Vanishing Point a ton, but the idea of spending that kind of money on a pen would be irresponsible and stupid for me. I got mine from eBay. Don't know if that would make a difference, but for the price I paid, which was like 28 ish USD, I love it and think it is a great value. It came with a bunch of accessories and converters and stuff. My A1 can go weeks without me using it. It writes maybe just a tad wet even. Maybe I got lucky with mine? I mean I think the stock nib is fine. I admit I may be newer to fountain pens, but I just don't see how the feel could be 4 times as good if you compare prices. I kinda figured, My A1 is fantastic. Cant fathom the VP being 4 times better when you compare it price wise. Sounds like you know what you like and have some experience! I am pretty new to fountain pens, but I do really enjoy writing with them! The 144 looks like a beautiful pen! Cherish it! Yeah, my A1 is great, which is why I made this post. I just can't fathom that the VP would be like 4 times better or whatever the math works out to price wise. At that point you‚Äôre at the cost of an OEM gray market VP though‚Ä¶ Interesting idea... Does the spring from your Majohn work on the Decimo? Fine nibs are available on AliExpress.  I bought one (two actually) and replaced the EF on my A2 I like EF as well, Thanks for the input, I will stick with my A1 then! I don't mind wear, actually kina like worn stuff. I bought a vanishing point Decimo a year ago. Out of the box, compete disappointment. Was already in the process of returning it. 

I tried cleaning it, drying it properly, swapping inks, everything. It wrote really poorly. Felt bad to use. One day I accidentally drop it on the nib on my hard floor. Since then, it writes flawlessly and things flow smoothly. Nib doesn‚Äôt look dented Better than the A1? I don‚Äôt know how to answer that.

I like writing with it more, sure. I‚Äôm also picky about how my pens write. What nib size do you have? Vanishing Point and Capless are different names used in different markets for the same pen. The VP is the Capless. Same pen. The VP is the Capless. Same pen. I have 3 A1s and 3 VPs, the diff is not that much. Enjoy! Where did you get your A1? My A1 and A2 dry out very quick, rendering them pretty useless. Fair enough. Yeah, I have a weird/non standard pen grip so I prefer the no clip, but I think the people who are bothered by the clip are the minority. I just like that Moonman offers both. If Pilot sold a no clip version, I‚Äôd definitely buy that. <EF> on both. Thicker nibs may not have as much of an issue. I've had my VPs stay wet for a couple months. Ten years is wild. ?üòÇ Well, that's fountain pens in general. You start getting diminishing returns after a certain point. A $60 pen isn't twice as good as a $30 pen, but it might have a more interesting filling system or made with a more interesting material. Or maybe better quality control. It's hard to quantify how much that's ""worth.""

Once you start getting into the >$100 mark you start seeing gold nibs, and those can definitely be more fun to write with than steel nibs (usually they're a little softer than steel nibs, but not always). But a well tuned steel nib will get you 99% of the way there if we're talking purely practical concerns.

That's kind of the nice thing about fountain pens IMO. You can spend to the moon and back if you want to and get some really cool unique pens, but you don't have to. A good $20-$30 pen will last you many many years. Very true. That's fair. Go with what your budget allows, and if you don't like the form factor, it was only like <insert current price of A1> lost and not, in some cases, hundreds. But I definitely recommend you get the real thing eventually. It's a beautiful pen.

The funny thing about the A1 is, that pen got me back into fountain pens. I saw it on amazon and was intrigued, did some digging and found it was a copy of my already beloved brand Pilot. I bought a Fermo instead, and am now swimming in pens again. I don't really feel bad for Pilot but I wish Moonman/Majohn was more innovative with their designs. Clearly their engineers and designers are very talented but they're using tried and true designs from other companies as a bit of a crutch.

I wonder if part of it is market demand. I have a few Moonman pens that are original designs (some of them are pretty cool IMO) and they're just not popular at all. I guess they're making what people want to buy, and what people want to buy are more affordable versions of popular expensive pens. Bit of a shame, personally.

I wouldn't mind so much if they cribbed some older designs that aren't in production anymore and made them popular again though. A new Snorkel maybe? That would be awesome. 

Or a new Myu-like (especially since Pilot won't make them again). I'd buy a $50 Majohn Myu-man in a heartbeat. I don't have it in me to spend $175 on a Pilot Myu and then be too afraid to use it because it's irreplaceable. It‚Äôs a pen sub, why are you criticising spending money on pens? You don‚Äôt have to buy it if you don‚Äôt want it.  Innovator isn‚Äôt a stretch, they invented it I probably just need to tune mine, and the ink I'm using is probably a bit of a drier ink. Storing it tip-down has helped considerably though. =D Oh that‚Äôs giving me too much credit, I was honestly just influenced by all the youtube reviews and just went like ‚Äúeh, worse case I‚Äôm out like $30‚Äù when deciding on A1. I tought so too, also my expectations while trying a montblanc or very expensive pens, luckily, majohn just outperforms in its field and the manufacturers didn't went lazy on the actual performances

Also, I would suggest you to try the 2024 version with a fine nib, it's just great True and then you may as well get it all VP, unless you prefer one of the A1 colors. I like the A2 better, myself. Totally worth it, especially if you can get your hands on a VP nib unit for cheap (second hand, discounted, transplanted, etc). I have a 10ish year old 1.1 Stub unit in a A2 and love it, the og body was beat to crap from daily pocket carry. It's lighter than the all brass units and still has a lovely writing feel. There's just a slight friction when using the MaJohn on my Decimo, if you could call it friction. I feel the resistance slightly harder on the clicker, therefore the spring feels tighter. It does not affect how the nib comes out of the pen barrel. That's nice, I didn't know, i might try one for my A2, I really hate how that one writes Then you will actually really like the A1. It looked like a treasured well used item in about six months of use. It didn't break, but just looked worn. I‚Äôve had my A1 for a few months now, no scratches.. I don‚Äôt use a pen pouch as it is my EDC my understanding was that the VP has a gold nib and the capless has an alloy nib, but the other features are equal I got it on eBay a while back. It is actually branded as MoonMan, which is the old company name I think, so maybe it was an older one? Not an expert, which is why I made this post haha. Yeah, mine is actually maybe a little on the wetter side, it takes a few for the ink to dry, but really feels about right. I love mine! Sorry about yours :( Thinking the same. I‚Äôd love to have enough great pens I could forget a VP ten years ?ü§© I agree that when moonman/majohn does something original it‚Äôs interesting at the very least, I think they do good tweaks on the pens they ‚Äúrip-off‚Äù. One of the biggest things I like about my own A1 that I‚Äôve never seen on a VP is a textured body. I love the look and feel of the fish scale body. I like the option of clip or clip-less. 

I think we all kind of forget that most of their products are meant for the internal Chinese market and less for international markets. I also think that it‚Äôs not the worst thing in the world to have a less expensive option, I‚Äôd feel much better spending $40 and thinking ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt for me‚Äô instead of $160 Where was I criticizing? Was it the sentence I started with ‚ÄúHell for me personally‚Äù and ended with ‚Äúfor me‚Äù? 

It was innovative a literal half century ago. In the intervening time people have been born, lived a fulfilling life and have died in the gap between when the Vanishing point released and when the A1 released. I‚Äôm not discounting their work on it, nor am I saying that they should stop making them or anything like that. I hope pilot takes people buying the A1/2/3 as a wake up call to do more. It‚Äôs competition, do you know who benefits from companies having to compete with each other? The consumer, us we win in that fight. There is the capless alloy nib on the Amazon pilot store too. $60-80?

A brief skim didn‚Äôt show any stubs though, so my wallet stayed closed. I also didn‚Äôt look too hard because I don‚Äôt need to be buying more pens, especially ones in ambivalent about‚Ä¶ Right‚Ä¶ Thanks for sharing!! ?ü§© The nibs slide off like a Lamy but it was pretty snug.  I used a dull knife blade to push it off the feed.  There‚Äôs little tabs on the back of the nib that you can push on Try using it in inverse. Since doing this my A2 has been my EDC.. I swapped the A2 nib into the A1 matte black body though. According to [this article](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2023/4/28/pilot-vanishing-pointcapless-fountain-pens-a-quick-comparison), the VP (sold outside Japan) always has a gold nib. The Capless (the name in Japan) has a gold nib, and can sometimes be found with an alloy nib (not sure if there is a specific name for it). oh huh, I didn't know that.¬† mine has the alloy nib and it is just not very good, which is atypical of pilot in my experience. I have an e95s and a prera and I absolutely love both. this capless is just not exactly the bomb and I don't know if it's fixable or not¬† You can buy a gold nib for it. That will set you back about $90-$100 though (while a whole pen is $170). You can take advantage of that to try a different nib size or style too if you wanted.";;
Had to test my x-ray machine so.... Why not take a peek at the mechanisms of a Pilot Vanishing Point Decimo? (Sorry for quality, took a photo on the Computer Screen);;"This is some original content haha, it looks so cool! Stupid question but does anybody else have issues with this pen leaking inside the barrel? Just a quick question, love the photo BTW: why do you have an x-ray machine? Ahhh.. this Pilot VP Decimo is my next pen. Just a question of when?üòÖ No lie, that would be a sick version of a VP if they could mimic that in an actual release. Skeleton and white! I‚Äôve done this before with my case of 10. It‚Äôs so interesting! Wowsies, this is next level my friend.

....(Note to self: I have to try this when I get to be a doctor.) *flexes x-ray machine and vanishing point simultaneously Op says 'sorry for the quality' as they tear away the fabric of existence and allow us to stare beyond the confines of sight. 

This is super cool. And for anyone who's curious, the ink in the pen is DeAtramentis Alexander Hamilton! I work for a digital xray manufacturing company. I could literally xray anything I want. Maybe I should take advantage of that and make some reddit OC sometime.. all I have is already clear TWSBI which takes the fun out of pens I think. Very nice. I've done this with my phone in our main X-Ray room, and on my TWSBI on our smaller NNICU portable machine to test a theory I had about a recurring artifact my coworkers saw a lot, but I never saw myself. Turned out I used a higher kV, they used a Higher mAs, the extra penetration I used resulted in elimination of the artifact caused by the algorithm the computer used. The artifact was the internals of the board itself on their pictures.


Edit: Phone 
https://i.imgur.com/XV8hgWV_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium Why do you own an X-ray? Pilot ‚ÄòNo Longer Vanishing‚Äô Point I think the quality adds more character to the photo haha tint it pink or blue and you got some major vaporwave vibes! I wonder how it would look with sheening/glimmering ink That‚Äôs pretty neat! Great, now when your ink gets angry it will turn green... If only they would make a demonstrator version of the vp... I want one That's so cool! So... the converter doesn't need a cap yet a cartridge DOES?

It looks like the plunger directly contacts the converter from the looks of it.

Cool pic! This makes me want a clear vanishing point The shenanigans you can get away with while testing! I've yet to encounter that issue, but to the poor fool who might suffer that fate?

I wish you skill. I have actually. Not sure what causes it. Multiple different inks do it for me I have, when I shake it or I click really forcefully, but most of the time there's a drop or two that gets in the barrel and on the nib Yeah I‚Äôve found that the converter piston sometimes just rotated on it‚Äôs own from playing around with the pen My first vp didn't do that but my second one leaks inside the barrel like crazy. I emailed pilots about it and you can get it fixed by them if you reach out to them. Not leaking inside the barrel, but if there's any nib creep then when you retract the nib there will always be some residue on the inside. I work xray in an outpatient office! Had some issues with the machine yesterday, and the engineer wanted me to do some test xrays after the fix, so I seized an opportunity! What color are you getting? Get real buddy buddy with your radiology department, and you start earning brownie points when you don't go ham on x-ray/CT orders Dude. I don't know if I've ever heard of a situation where the artifact was the board's internals! Interesting. I don't own it, it belongs to the clinic I work for .... Ooh, I'll have to try! I know I got a sample of shimmering ink, so I'll probably do a test shot! Gotta make sure the machine is working somehow I'm reminded of that time a year or so ago where people were marveling at someone's freehand drawn perfect circle and this guy printed out the picture and put it into a ~$10,000 machine he has at work specifically meant for determining how circular something is. Yes !!!! I worked on a long range optical tracking device with an IR camera. We were able to determine which employees were having ‚Äúnooners‚Äù based on images when walking on from lunch. There was much geek chuckling.... Are you using a rubber/soft converter and keeping the pen in your pocket? Probably the most original shot of a fountain pen, I love it! There's only 1 available here, and that's black rhodium trim. I wish the store here have more options. That's why I'm still not buying?üòÖ XD haha I'll see if I can find my testing images when I go to shut it off later tonight. I was confused as well, cause like I said, I literally never saw it on my images, only my coworkers. I did a range of techniques and Collimation experiments to narrow down a probable cause when my shift was slower one weekend. Only then did I see it for myself. 

 I would use roughly 65-68kV@ 0.4-0.5 mAs, NNICU babies, so that unit doesn't need a lot at all. My range allowed a lower dose, with danm near perfect exposure films and no questioning for tiny tiny line placements (them bitches can be invisible sometimes) Coworkers always used, and swore by, 58kV@.32 mAs, almost exclusively. They encountered a lot of issues besides just the artifact stuff. 

So what it ended up being was, they used so little, that the backscatter from the inside of the board wasn't effectively filtered out by the algorithms. It needed more penetration to accurately ignore those densities, but because they were denser due to the lower technique it resulted in what looked like circuits and computer components vaguely visible in the anatomy and around the imaging area. The fix was to move to my Techniques. No more repeats, better quality, and minimal dose. ?üëç Ah ok And this is a great solution that doesn't endanger any humans (i know i would be tempted to take a full body x-ray of myself but i know that's not safe) ... I feel like I went over-the-top extra considering the x ray machine alone costs... $220k (and this is an old machine to boot) Do you have a link perchance? I just have the normal Pilot Con-40, and most of the time it's just laying horizontally on my desk. I don't even take it anywhere! Meh, depends on the setting. X-rays are relatively safe. You will only glow in the dark, that's all ?üòÅ I was laughing at that as well haha. My former school obtained a brand new X-ray room in my last 2 semesters and we took part of the initial testing of the entire unit. The boards alone, not even the grids with them, cost about $15k a peice.

Once. Hah! You win for sure. :D [I'm honestly surprised it was the first result, lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1fodga/ugooseslayer_starts_a_war_against_ukevin3drinks/)

I would have sworn it would be unfindable. Sounds like the converter isnt fully sealing up with the nib unit, does it happen with ink cartridges? Yeah but As Little As Reasonably Possible A finger technique for a pen? I'm not sure it's the converter that's leaking. The metal barrel never has any ink on it, nor does the converter. It just seems like ink is burping out of the breather hole excessively. I do live in a mountainous town, I wonder if when my ears pop while going up to work, my pen burps too? ?üòÇ Modern medical x-rays deliver less radiation than an airline flight. Yeah thats probably it, the air inside the converter is pushing the ink out when you ascend, try to keep it nib up when you carry it with you Huh! So, stupid question then: why all the rigamarole of the lead apron, if not to follow the ""as little as reasonably possible"" ideal? ALARA- As Low As Reasonably Achievable
 - I only correct this because my former school director would snap my neck if I missed that test question today ?ü§£. 


Within Radiography there are multiple different graphs which are utilized to compare the amount of radiation exposure, with the risk or chance of adverse effects. While it is somewhat contested, generally the most accepted is a Linear Non-Threshold curve. This graph is basically a diagnal line from start to end; the start being no effects with no dose, and the end being high chance of effects with an increased dose. Even if it is contested by some experts, the approach you take with it isn't inherently bad. The general mindset one takes with this Linear outlook is that any radiation exposure can result in adverse effects. It's view is that there isn't a minimum safe amount of radiation exposure. The effects of Radiation of varying levels is still widely studied and honestly, not completely understood; because it is literally just chance on whether or not stochastic effects can be caused by radiation exposure. You could never undergo a radiologic procedure, and have multiple cancers later in life, or you could undergo several for many years, and never have a noticeable effect.

My personal view for this is; there is no reason to not percieve every radiation exposure as potentially harming. If I get lazy with my collimation, beam centering or positioning, and I have to reshoot the X-ray through no fault of the patient; then I am placing more potential risk on that patient as a result of my negligent behavior. Will that give them cancer later in life? Probably not, but radiation exposure can, and does cause mutations and damage even if it self repaired or never grew enough to be seen. But there is that chance. 

 Anyway, I rambled. Sorry I love my field ?üòê. You asked about Lead gowns if X-rays aren't that damaging or unsafe. Car are safer than they have been in decades with incredible advances in safety and structural engineering. So therefore, you have no need to wear a seat belt, right? Wrong. A Chest X-ray can be roughly (depending on patient mass/size) comparable to about 10 days in the sun, so a nice beach vacation. That's 1 chest X-ray. Just today alone I took over twenty Chest X-rays, not to mention assisting in numerous Fluoroscopy cases. We are exposed to radiation in our jobs every single day we work, along with the normal background radiation every human is exposed to naturally. So despite the incredible advances in imaging technology, radiation is radiation, and it adds up. There are only 3 ways to reduce your radiation exposure in the field; Time, Distance, Shielding. Lower the exposure time of the beam, or the frequency at which you fluoro, physically distance yourself from the source of the radiation, or shield yourself from it when the other 2 are not possible. 

TlDR: If you're a smart Technologist, you wear your seat belt.

And and extra fun chart! 
https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Radiology-Safety/Radiation-Safety/Dose-Reference-Card.pdf I came here to say this; thanks for saying it in way more detail than I could manage this evening. I agree with you that it is best to take all reasonable precautions regarding radiation, my point was simply that the relative danger is not what people perceive it to be.

When I was a radiation worker (nuclear subs) we did everything possible to keep our exposure to ionizing radiation as low as possible as well. Fun story, when decommissioning my first boat myself and another mechanic ""discovered"" a hotspot in the reactor compartment missed by the shipyard's survey. I recieved 200 milirems (the lower dose) and the other guy recieved almost 300 milirems. We weren't allowed to do work anywhere near a radiation source for the rest of the year (exposure limits for the Navy go by calendar year, not a rolling year). I was about to say something to this effect, but shorter: 
The extra radiation dose of one transatlantic flight is fine, but you wouldn't want to expose yourself to thirty of those every working day of your life. Hence the protective gear for everyone except the patient.";1470;https://i.redd.it/l3fco8p2l6561.jpg;fountainpens;"Had to test my x-ray machine so.... Why not take a peek at the mechanisms of a Pilot Vanishing Point Decimo? (Sorry for quality, took a photo on the Computer Screen)  This is some original content haha, it looks so cool! Stupid question but does anybody else have issues with this pen leaking inside the barrel? Just a quick question, love the photo BTW: why do you have an x-ray machine? Ahhh.. this Pilot VP Decimo is my next pen. Just a question of when?üòÖ No lie, that would be a sick version of a VP if they could mimic that in an actual release. Skeleton and white! I‚Äôve done this before with my case of 10. It‚Äôs so interesting! Wowsies, this is next level my friend.

....(Note to self: I have to try this when I get to be a doctor.) *flexes x-ray machine and vanishing point simultaneously Op says 'sorry for the quality' as they tear away the fabric of existence and allow us to stare beyond the confines of sight. 

This is super cool. And for anyone who's curious, the ink in the pen is DeAtramentis Alexander Hamilton! I work for a digital xray manufacturing company. I could literally xray anything I want. Maybe I should take advantage of that and make some reddit OC sometime.. all I have is already clear TWSBI which takes the fun out of pens I think. Very nice. I've done this with my phone in our main X-Ray room, and on my TWSBI on our smaller NNICU portable machine to test a theory I had about a recurring artifact my coworkers saw a lot, but I never saw myself. Turned out I used a higher kV, they used a Higher mAs, the extra penetration I used resulted in elimination of the artifact caused by the algorithm the computer used. The artifact was the internals of the board itself on their pictures.


Edit: Phone 
https://i.imgur.com/XV8hgWV_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium Why do you own an X-ray? Pilot ‚ÄòNo Longer Vanishing‚Äô Point I think the quality adds more character to the photo haha tint it pink or blue and you got some major vaporwave vibes! I wonder how it would look with sheening/glimmering ink That‚Äôs pretty neat! Great, now when your ink gets angry it will turn green... If only they would make a demonstrator version of the vp... I want one That's so cool! So... the converter doesn't need a cap yet a cartridge DOES?

It looks like the plunger directly contacts the converter from the looks of it.

Cool pic! This makes me want a clear vanishing point The shenanigans you can get away with while testing! I've yet to encounter that issue, but to the poor fool who might suffer that fate?

I wish you skill. I have actually. Not sure what causes it. Multiple different inks do it for me I have, when I shake it or I click really forcefully, but most of the time there's a drop or two that gets in the barrel and on the nib Yeah I‚Äôve found that the converter piston sometimes just rotated on it‚Äôs own from playing around with the pen My first vp didn't do that but my second one leaks inside the barrel like crazy. I emailed pilots about it and you can get it fixed by them if you reach out to them. Not leaking inside the barrel, but if there's any nib creep then when you retract the nib there will always be some residue on the inside. I work xray in an outpatient office! Had some issues with the machine yesterday, and the engineer wanted me to do some test xrays after the fix, so I seized an opportunity! What color are you getting? Get real buddy buddy with your radiology department, and you start earning brownie points when you don't go ham on x-ray/CT orders Dude. I don't know if I've ever heard of a situation where the artifact was the board's internals! Interesting. I don't own it, it belongs to the clinic I work for .... Ooh, I'll have to try! I know I got a sample of shimmering ink, so I'll probably do a test shot! Gotta make sure the machine is working somehow I'm reminded of that time a year or so ago where people were marveling at someone's freehand drawn perfect circle and this guy printed out the picture and put it into a ~$10,000 machine he has at work specifically meant for determining how circular something is. Yes !!!! I worked on a long range optical tracking device with an IR camera. We were able to determine which employees were having ‚Äúnooners‚Äù based on images when walking on from lunch. There was much geek chuckling.... Are you using a rubber/soft converter and keeping the pen in your pocket? Probably the most original shot of a fountain pen, I love it! There's only 1 available here, and that's black rhodium trim. I wish the store here have more options. That's why I'm still not buying?üòÖ XD haha I'll see if I can find my testing images when I go to shut it off later tonight. I was confused as well, cause like I said, I literally never saw it on my images, only my coworkers. I did a range of techniques and Collimation experiments to narrow down a probable cause when my shift was slower one weekend. Only then did I see it for myself. 

 I would use roughly 65-68kV@ 0.4-0.5 mAs, NNICU babies, so that unit doesn't need a lot at all. My range allowed a lower dose, with danm near perfect exposure films and no questioning for tiny tiny line placements (them bitches can be invisible sometimes) Coworkers always used, and swore by, 58kV@.32 mAs, almost exclusively. They encountered a lot of issues besides just the artifact stuff. 

So what it ended up being was, they used so little, that the backscatter from the inside of the board wasn't effectively filtered out by the algorithms. It needed more penetration to accurately ignore those densities, but because they were denser due to the lower technique it resulted in what looked like circuits and computer components vaguely visible in the anatomy and around the imaging area. The fix was to move to my Techniques. No more repeats, better quality, and minimal dose. ?üëç Ah ok And this is a great solution that doesn't endanger any humans (i know i would be tempted to take a full body x-ray of myself but i know that's not safe) ...

My word those are stunning! ?üò©?üò©?üò© An absolutely beautiful set!! Gorgeous. My galaxy (with custom nib grind) is my favorite pen! I fell in love with the galaxy pattern, but seeing the others like that.... Omg those are gorgeous Good gravy those are yummy. The ones on eBay that are listed for $580 plus shipping are very tempting I'm getting strong magical space-ship vibes. Congratulations! One of those was my grail pen and I finally bought it after many years. It writes (of course) like a dream and is just so gorgeous. I'm very happy for you that you have all three :) I think this is my favorite same-pen-collection so far. Those pens are too dang gorgeous! What nib sizes do each of them have? Gorgeous! I, too, have the set ([https://ibb.co/WtNSKKm](https://ibb.co/WtNSKKm)) and they're the pride of my collection. I hope you enjoy them for many years to come. I have the Galaxy; it's my favorite! Those are reeeeeeeally pretty. Can't even pick a favorite. That's the one I'm missing. Soon. Hopefully soon. :) Did you find that the position of the clip affects your grip, or how comfortable it is to write with? ?üòç I really like and want the galaxy one but never had the chance to buy in local shops. Importing it from Japan is out of the question since customs here kinda sucks Thanks for the inspiration, I just ordered the water surface I‚Äôve been drooling over for a year!! Just the stripe left now! I recently purchased a Decimo and when I say my future fp purchases will only be Capless/VP, I mean it. I am aiming for the Galaxy next.

The workmanship of Pilot is really amazing, but I am kind of worried that the original VP's girth will be a little hard to hold for my hand. Dang it I want that raden stripe ! Don't mind me, sitting over in the corner, drooling over your pens. 

::deep sigh:: Amazing collection I might or might not be obsessed with them. The single word is the perfect sentiment They really are beautiful writers in every way. Thank you! Thank you! Honestly I was the same until I got my fist one. It was the galaxy and it was so beautiful. Plus the reliability of VP was the selling point. I hope you get to see one in person because wow, say bye to $$$ Great minds! Galaxy was my first! I hope you get the rest of the set soon. How do you store yours? Once you get one, the other 2 will be on your list. They‚Äôre beautiful and writes soooo well Galaxy, hands down. It was my first and still my favorite of the 3. On first pic top to bottom: stripe, water surface, Galaxy Thank you! Thank you! Wish I could really capture the colors of it *adds penviousness to internal dictionary* thank you! Thank you! I wish they made more raden but also thankful they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. I wish I could really show how beautiful they are, especially in the sun! Thank you! Thank you! I might have sat there and pet them a little while taking photos‚Ä¶ I purchased the stripes from jet pens for $561.50 with free shipping. They‚Äôre reputable and super fast shipping. Definitely recommend checking them out before eBay! Thank you! I love the reliability of all VP pens I‚Äôve had the pleasure of writing with. Do you plan on getting the rest of the trio? I have 2 fine and 1 extra fine. I‚Äôm a big fan of Japanese small nibs, perfect for my small handwriting. Raden is truly beautiful, I never understood it until I got my first one They‚Äôre my pride and joy right now as well. Thank you! Mine too!!! I hope you complete your set soon! The clip does not bother me at all. The pen is quite comfortable in hand and clip position is perfectly in between my fingers. It‚Äôs one of few pens I can hold comfortably for hours. (Yes, literally writing for hours!) Galaxy was my first and still my favorite. I do hope you get a chance to buy locally! Sorry to hear custom sucks. I take it you‚Äôre not in US - does your custom suck for all international mail? Yes!!! Happy to enable! If it helps, here's a shot of a Decimo with a standard ballpoint, a VP, and a Mont Blanc 146. The VP isn't that much bigger, but if you have particularly small hands, it could make a difference.

[Decimo size comparison ](http://imgur.com/a/sYIEpKE) Galaxy was my first and still my favorite! I have small hands and started with second and went up to regular VP. It‚Äôs not too big me and still quite comfortable! Join me in the drooling! (Yes I‚Äôm still drooling over them) I still haven't gone over the $200 Canadian mark for a pen, but perhaps someday. I can't even fathom owning all three of these. Quite a beautiful trio! I have to thank you for helping me focus. Despite having 12 VPs of various kinds, I've been cruising for another, non-standard, one. I was leaning toward a green kasuri or red wood, but I've seen the light. My wife is not going to understand $500+ for yet another pen (much less $1500 for three), so I'll have to dig into my surplus pen and watch boxes and start selling. Then I can call it a trade. I have it in a satin pen roll, stored in a dark, cool place. Any tips? Do you have any other VP's? I love my matte black, and I assume the radens are the same ""pen"" as far as writing feel is concerned?

IE you are paying for the fancy body, it's otherwise the same as any other VP? Thanks! They really are all gorgeous- whether it‚Äôs the first purchase or the last, you consistently have good taste. Of course the more i look at them the more they seem like a matched trio. So one needs them all ( to myself-look away!! >Follow

?üôÇI  for one do not blame you a bit. ?üôÇ I actually have 2 of them -- the Water Surface and the Raden Stripe. (Got the Stripe at a good price back at a time when the Water Surfaces were almost impossible to find. The Water Surface came later :) So while I'm not planning to buy the Galaxy, who knows...

By the way, I practice Japanese tea ceremony, where it's not unusual to have touches of raden inlaid into lacquered wooden items such as tea caddies; in fact, that was my introduction to the concept of raden as decorative inlay. Seeing it used in a fountain pen just blew me away!

P.S. Here's an avant-garde kogo (incense container for tea ceremony) that extensively uses raden: [https://collections.lacma.org/node/214960](https://collections.lacma.org/node/214960)

P.P.S. Raden can show up in unusual places. Here's [a tiny touch of raden on a kimono](https://imgur.com/a/EGrSQo4)! Thanks! I'm considering getting the galaxy at some point. Yes, its just‚Ä¶ really slow and the taxes to bring goods in its just too expensive lol they charge almost a quarter of the good prices for goods that is more expensive than US$3 I‚Äôm so excited!! Where did you pick up the stripe? That‚Äôs super helpful thank you! It really doesn‚Äôt look that much thicker. 

Currently the decimo feels perfect for my hand while writing so to really decide I might have to go to a pen shop and try holding it in person. Sounds like we keep it the same! When I‚Äôm not using it, I keep it in the original wood box with lining. When inked, I keep it in rickshaw pen roll with the super soft lining. I do have a few more and yes, you‚Äôre paying more for the urushi and raden work. Nib is the same Thank you! Pilot VP is one of my weaknesses.. Got it from jet pens! Very reputable and best price for them. I paid $561.50 I literally don‚Äôt put it down! So it‚Äôs gotta be close to me. I feel like a parent picking favorites hahaha I was just looking there‚Ä¶ I might need that one too. They‚Äôre not limited edition are they? Not to my knowledge, they‚Äôve been around for years. Only thing is keeping them in stock when its good price Right. It‚Äôs a hard hard call but I think I‚Äôm going to wait. I don‚Äôt need both today, I can order again in a couple weeks or something! It‚Äôs already here (western US) from stilo&stile and friend!! You penabled me in the best way. It is so much more stunning than the pictures show!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!! Yes!!!!! Happy to enable lol. Which one did you get?? I got water surface but I really really want stripe too! Maybe next month!

On first pic top to bottom: stripe, water surface, Galaxy Thank you! Thank you! Wish I could really capture the colors of it *adds penviousness to internal dictionary* thank you! Thank you! I wish they made more raden but also thankful they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. I wish I could really show how beautiful they are, especially in the sun! Thank you! Thank you! I might have sat there and pet them a little while taking photos‚Ä¶ I purchased the stripes from jet pens for $561.50 with free shipping. They‚Äôre reputable and super fast shipping. Definitely recommend checking them out before eBay! Thank you! I love the reliability of all VP pens I‚Äôve had the pleasure of writing with. Do you plan on getting the rest of the trio? I have 2 fine and 1 extra fine. I‚Äôm a big fan of Japanese small nibs, perfect for my small handwriting. Raden is truly beautiful, I never understood it until I got my first one They‚Äôre my pride and joy right now as well. Thank you! Mine too!!! I hope you complete your set soon! The clip does not bother me at all. The pen is quite comfortable in hand and clip position is perfectly in between my fingers. It‚Äôs one of few pens I can hold comfortably for hours. (Yes, literally writing for hours!) Galaxy was my first and still my favorite. I do hope you get a chance to buy locally! Sorry to hear custom sucks. I take it you‚Äôre not in US - does your custom suck for all international mail? Yes!!! Happy to enable! If it helps, here's a shot of a Decimo with a standard ballpoint, a VP, and a Mont Blanc 146. The VP isn't that much bigger, but if you have particularly small hands, it could make a difference.

[Decimo size comparison ](http://imgur.com/a/sYIEpKE) Galaxy was my first and still my favorite! I have small hands and started with second and went up to regular VP. It‚Äôs not too big me and still quite comfortable! Join me in the drooling! (Yes I‚Äôm still drooling over them) I still haven't gone over the $200 Canadian mark for a pen, but perhaps someday. I can't even fathom owning all three of these. Quite a beautiful trio! I have to thank you for helping me focus. Despite having 12 VPs of various kinds, I've been cruising for another, non-standard, one. I was leaning toward a green kasuri or red wood, but I've seen the light. My wife is not going to understand $500+ for yet another pen (much less $1500 for three), so I'll have to dig into my surplus pen and watch boxes and start selling. Then I can call it a trade. I have it in a satin pen roll, stored in a dark, cool place. Any tips? Do you have any other VP's? I love my matte black, and I assume the radens are the same ""pen"" as far as writing feel is concerned?

IE you are paying for the fancy body, it's otherwise the same as any other VP? Thanks! They really are all gorgeous- whether it‚Äôs the first purchase or the last, you consistently have good taste. Of course the more i look at them the more they seem like a matched trio. So one needs them all ( to myself-look away!! >Follow

?üôÇI  for one do not blame you a bit. ?üôÇ I actually have 2 of them -- the Water Surface and the Raden Stripe. (Got the Stripe at a good price back at a time when the Water Surfaces were almost impossible to find. The Water Surface came later :) So while I'm not planning to buy the Galaxy, who knows...

By the way, I practice Japanese tea ceremony, where it's not unusual to have touches of raden inlaid into lacquered wooden items such as tea caddies; in fact, that was my introduction to the concept of raden as decorative inlay. Seeing it used in a fountain pen just blew me away!

P.S. Here's an avant-garde kogo (incense container for tea ceremony) that extensively uses raden: [https://collections.lacma.org/node/214960](https://collections.lacma.org/node/214960)

P.P.S. Raden can show up in unusual places. Here's [a tiny touch of raden on a kimono](https://imgur.com/a/EGrSQo4)! Thanks! I'm considering getting the galaxy at some point. Yes, its just‚Ä¶ really slow and the taxes to bring goods in its just too expensive lol they charge almost a quarter of the good prices for goods that is more expensive than US$3 I‚Äôm so excited!! Where did you pick up the stripe? That‚Äôs super helpful thank you! It really doesn‚Äôt look that much thicker. 

Currently the decimo feels perfect for my hand while writing so to really decide I might have to go to a pen shop and try holding it in person. Sounds like we keep it the same! When I‚Äôm not using it, I keep it in the original wood box with lining. When inked, I keep it in rickshaw pen roll with the super soft lining. I do have a few more and yes, you‚Äôre paying more for the urushi and raden work. Nib is the same Thank you! Pilot VP is one of my weaknesses.. Got it from jet pens! Very reputable and best price for them. I paid $561.50 I literally don‚Äôt put it down! So it‚Äôs gotta be close to me. I feel like a parent picking favorites hahaha I was just looking there‚Ä¶ I might need that one too. They‚Äôre not limited edition are they? Not to my knowledge, they‚Äôve been around for years. Only thing is keeping them in stock when its good price Right. It‚Äôs a hard hard call but I think I‚Äôm going to wait. I don‚Äôt need both today, I can order again in a couple weeks or something! It‚Äôs already here (western US) from stilo&stile and friend!! You penabled me in the best way. It is so much more stunning than the pictures show!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!! Yes!!!!! Happy to enable lol. Which one did you get?? I got water surface but I really really want stripe too! Maybe next month! I‚Äôll be sure to report back when it happens!";;
NPD: my grail (for now) arrived. The Pilot Capless (vanishing point) Matte Black in medium. I‚Äôm shaking - months of saving and waiting and I‚Äôm so happy!!!;;"I see you‚Äôre doing the classic ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to write so I‚Äôm going to write about writing with my fountain pen because I just want to write something.‚Äù Just looked this up. What is the difference between the 156.00 and 800.00 dollar versions. Beautiful but holy cow Very sleek! The grey ink is a nice match too! Congrats! As a very happy owner of multiple Pilots, I'm always going back and forth on whether I'll eventually have a Vanishing Point as a grail pen. Glad you're enjoying it so much!! Congrats on the grail acquisition! Is the ""Capless"" branding something regional, or is this distinct from what I'd see in the US as a Vanishing Point?

In any case, I have LOVED my VPs for literally decades. Great pens, great daily drivers. You won't be sorry! They‚Äôre good pens. I think they are particularly well suited to use at work and for note taking. They‚Äôre great when you need to use the pen one handed and may be frequently uncapping and recapping. Plus the soft nib has an enjoyable bounce to it. 

I don‚Äôt head to work meetings without mine. Fuyu shogun is my fav ink haha, can recognize it straight from your writings I love my vanishing point. Absolutely incredible pen. I rarely use anything else Congratulations.  It‚Äôs a stunning pen, do enjoy. Congrats!  Very similar situation on my end--just landed a new job (yes, even in this current climate) and, after a year and a half of waiting, pulled the trigger.  Loving my VP for work and home!  My true ""grail"" is a homo sapiens, but that is still wayyy down the list of financial priorities lol Congrats on a grail achieved! Saving up and sacrificing makes attaining something even more special. Enjoy it, you deserve it The finish shines up over time instead of wearing off in patches (which was my fear). It gives it a nice patina without looking shabby. If TWSBI hadn‚Äôt spoiled me for unnecessarily large ink capacities, my VP would still be my daily driver. No worries, If you get the chance try out a stub nib on it at some point. The Vanishing point stubs are one of my favorite stubs to write with! Congrats! My VP and my Decimo are my favourite pens! It's beautiful! I love how sleek the matte black looks That is particularly nice in that Matte Black. Congrats on the grail acquisition! I sold off my stealth VP and I regret doing so.... great pen. This is my favorite every day writer. I have two. BE CAREFUL! They dent EASY!! 
[Dent Picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/NfkyLHo) Isn't it great!? I got the pink one last week and I love it! 

Your strokes look crisp, what are you writing on here? I'm still looking for loose paper that doesn't bleed or feather under the medium nib. Beautiful pen! Great choice, I love my VP (M). It‚Äôs my main work pen!! Enjoy! The Vanishing point in matte black was my first big pen purchase too and I still use this bad boy as an everyday writer for work and what not to this day! I have the d√®cimo vp in red. I love it. Such a convenient edc. And I also have been using the fuyu-syogun a lot. It's almost replaced black for me. Almost. I got this bad boy in a stub. One of the few I always have inked. [deleted] I've been thinking of buying Pilot capless for a moment now. You just make me want to buy it. But I have to relax. I'll wait until I get into school again. Bought my matte blue vanishing point (fine) a few weeks ago and couldn't be happier!!! Congrats! Congrats! This pen is so good. This was my daily with a fine nib, but now ( today ) I started with a Lamy 2k Medium. That is my dream pen, is it amazing? Please tell me its awful. That's a beautiful pen. Congratulations.  
I hope I can buy one soon. Congrats ! Hey mate, I played with this exact pen at a store today and am now needing it in my life. How have you found it several months on?? https://i.imgur.com/NgPlNVC.jpg 

Hey Pen Buddy. You‚Äôll love the Vanishing Point / Capless! Get some Pilot Iroshizuku ink and you‚Äôll be set (for now). The bottles are sooo nice.

Or Emerald of Chivor ink which is currently on my wish list. [removed] And as it happens, you are now infected with the Fountain Pen Bug.....enjoy!! May I ask do you write a lot to warrant such expensive (but absolutely really cool) pens, or is it just a hobby? Genuinely interested Seriously, I was in between work and changing the diaper of my little one. So I could have written about financial accounting principles of the governmental building industry or the color of the poop I would be cleaning a few minutes later. So Im kinda happy by my choices here :-D 90% of my journals are writing about my writing and wanting to write and how I write and when I want to write again. Some people may not want to share anything personal on reddit I‚Äôve almost forgotten that a person can write about anything else Yes, as others mentioned there are really some works of art out there plus the ones that have a different retractable mechanism. There is also the Fermo which has a twist mechanism as far as I know. [deleted] Thank you. I‚Äôm a sucker for grey inks and this is my favorite. It‚Äôs fuyu-syogun from the Iroshizuku line by Pilot Yes, well, Pilot is it for me, too. They‚Äôre great pens and the convenience of this one sold it for me Thank you so much!! Yeah, it's the same pen just with different branding. VP is the cooler name IMO, but Capless feels very professional (which might be why the branding is different). Yes, that‚Äôs why I got it. It will probably be my go-to pen for work besides my 2000. understated design and great writing experience <3 It‚Äôs just my favorite, hands down. Distinct, classic, not boring and well behaved. What else could I want? Yes, I can definitely see that in my future as well :-D Thank you so much!! Congrats on your new job and your new pen!!! Yes, the HS is a grail for me too, it looks awesome. But it‚Äôs like 4x the Price of this one so even if I could afford it I probably could not justify it. I have a kid and that‚Äôs my financial priority so maybe a Van Gogh for me :-D but go at it and tell me how you liked it. I can enjoy it vicariously Thank you so much!! Yes, this marks a very special day in my book. Being fully able to afford it according to budget and being patient.... people are right when they say delayed gratification is the best! Yeah, it‚Äôll be interesting seeing this pen age, I‚Äôm so curious. Also I like to change inks often so c/c pens are my jam. I can see though why the large piston fillers definitely have their place :-) Thx for the recommendation. I‚Äôve yet to test the waters with stubs. Have an Eco-T with a stub nib and this thing is awfully scratchy and not at all a pleasure to write with. So if I‚Äôd get another stub nib, I‚Äôd want to try it before buying. 

Oh, wait, I have...like... a 2.6 (or 2.9?) Kaweco stub which is awesome. Maybe the Eco one was just a bad one Thank you! Is the difference in size very notable between these models? Oh yes. Saw it a couple of months ago and knew it had my name on it :-) Yes, i think so, too. It‚Äôs really a no-nonsense design this way - though I‚Äôm not saying the other designs are nonsense. Far from it. 
I do think though that this is a safe option. 
A person would likely grab a more fancy looking pen from my desk rather than this one....I hope Thank you so much!
And yes, sometimes it‚Äôs that way. Some years ago I sold my record collection. Over 700 records, some were really obscure and hard to come by metal releases and editions. I have all those records on my hard drive, but it‚Äôs almost 12 years since and I still regret it. 
But dude, there‚Äôs still the possibility of getting a replacement of this particular pen :-) Oh noooooo. I‚Äôm so sorry :-/ I promise to be careful!! Oh i love it! Congrats to yours as well :-) I can definitely see why you love it. 
To be honest, it‚Äôs copy paper I just grabbed from the office to take home since I‚Äôm in remote work for this week. 
I think the manufacturer is Mondi (I think they‚Äôre a European company) but I can check that with my colleagues in my office tomorrow if you like :-) Thank you very much. Yes, I can see and feel why you love yours so much :-) Thank you! Did you experience some kind of wear-out with the click mechanism? That‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm a bit worried about. Ha! I was deciding between a red one and the matte black. I can see we have similar taste. 
I‚Äòm still on the lookout for ‚Ä?my‚Äú black. I have Onyx black and Quartz black from Diamine.... but they‚Äôre not ‚Ä?my‚Äú black. I have to try Take-Sumi and Aurora black. People swear on those. What do you recommend? me too. And a Fermo in medium. Is it possible to get a replacement nib unit Asia stub? The Shops I‚Äôve been looking at only had fine, medium and broad <3 I‚Äôm so sorry. But you, you‚Äôre probably right and I think you‚Äôll even be happier when you‚Äôve waited with your purchase. Hell, I‚Äôm the best example for this Oh!! Congrats to you, too, pen buddy. This is awesome, I think we have years of great fun and usability ahead of us :-) Thank you so much! 
I have the 2000 in medium, too - that was a birthday gift from my dad. So this will have a special place in my heart anyways. But it helps that the 2k is such a fantastic pen. Have fun with it. I guess you will very much love it by the end of this day :-) It‚Äôs totally awful. The Click mechanism is rather hard to press, I didn‚Äôt expect that. 
Also: it‚Äôs just black. How boring is that?
It said the nib would be 18k gold. It‚Äôs not even gold! It‚Äôs silver, WTF!
The nib is way too smooth and man, this thing looks like a ballpoint when retracted. Who TF would want that??

Sorry, I can‚Äôt go through with that. It‚Äôs really amazing and worth keeping it as a grail pen. You won‚Äôt regret a single moment with it. Thank you very much! Fingers are crossed - you won‚Äôt regret it Thank you so much!! Short version: get it. It‚Äôs worth it. It really is. 
Sorry, am in a hurry, I‚Äôll write a more detailed answer tonight, if that‚Äôs okay for you ?üëç?üèª Oh my, thank you! 
Yes, I‚Äôve inked mine with Iroshizuku Fuyu-Syogun, which is one of my top 3 inks (Alt-Goldgruen by R&K and KWZ Maroon being the others) and it is just great!
By the way, what case are you using for your VPs btw? They seem so long that I have to yet find a solution to this. 
Oh, and EoC is a great ink, I‚Äôm more of a shading guy. I see the appeal though and the bottles look like very expensive perfumes <3 Thank you for the heads-up and the advice, especially in regards to cleaning!
I do hope though that the pen will develop some character over the years. Pictures of this model as beat up and used.... man, those have something to it! Oh, i have been for a while now, but this still is a milestone for me. Thank you so much!! Yes, you may, of course. 
I would not consider myself a heavy writer. All in all I think I write about 1 to 1,5 hours a day. This includes journaling and work. 
I‚Äôve had some mental health issues beginning of the year (nothing really serious but not good, either) and noticed how writing and especially journaling helped me focus more and be happier. So with that background I‚Äôm very happy to reward myself from time to time. And since I do 99% of my writing with fountain pens I thought that this particular pen purchase was definitely a good choice since I would benefit from it in several ways. 
So yes, maybe there are People out there that write a lot more than I do. But writing keeps me sane, organized, focused and happy. And I‚Äôm very happy to spend that kind of money this way for me :-) 
I won‚Äôt lie, though. This price for a pen feels like my limit. Even if money wasn‚Äôt an issue, I could not see myself spending like 500$ on a pen. But those thresholds are differ for different people This feels close to home, that's exactly what I am doing right now. [deleted] Thank you. Confirm raden water surface pen on gouletpens.com 
I‚Äôm now considering a vintage one on eBay for around 120. Exactly. That name just changes depending on sales region AFAIK I was under the impression that the VP had a gold nib and the Capless does not.  Am I mistaken? Thanks!  To make things even more complicated, the HS is also my wife's grail pen (specifically the magma for her) so when I finally do get one for myself, I probably need to have money set aside to get her one too before too long lol.  In the meantime, my ""next step"" pen is a metal falcon with a con 70 though... The ecos do have that issue with their stubs if you want to try a smooth 1.1 stub, try the Twsbi 580 diamond stub or the vac700 r stubs those are buttery smooth and even more so with a well lubricated ink like something from noodlers! And wow 2.6 is huge! I've yet to try a stub that big haha In the hand they do feel different, the Decimo is noticeably lighter and thinner. I see it as my dainty version of my VP - I have it in champagne pink and with an EF nib :) my VP is the 2020 Link Black version with a fine nib. being a real fan of great looking pens, I find yours very special in its classic look and sleek design.  I much prefer the matte finish on this pen.  A shiny lacquer would make the pen too ""busy"". None thankfully I've had mine for almost 3 years now (3rd year coming up in dec) and have had no issues with the mechanism! It is a very tried and tested design, I wouldn't worry too much about reliability. I haven't had to find out, but Pilot has a good reputation for after-sales support. The best black I have used is platinum carbon black. It's good, but not quite there for me. I have not tried the aurora black. I'll have to add it to my ever growing list of Inks to buy. How is the twist mechanism? The fermo Model really looks so awesome, like straight from another galaxy <3 Both the VP and the 2000 are my wife‚Äôs I just ‚Äúborrow‚Äù them LOL. Hope you enjoy the Pilot! Well I grudgingly admit I'm glad its not awful. ;) No that's super awesome, thanks ! 

It felt great in the hand, but they wouldn't let me try it out haha I have a custom made notebook holder with a 2 pen case attached to the front of it made by ([https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/StrideRidge?ref=usf\_2020](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/StrideRidge?ref=usf_2020)). I wanted a plush leather cover to hold my Leuchtturn1917 notebooks and I ask the maker to attach one of his leather pen cover holders to the cover (as you can see in the pic).  The cover fits perfectly over my note book, has 3 custom slots for business cards on the inside, the back flap has a slit in it to allow for the enclosure band to still work and allows me to access the gusseted pocket on the back cover.

I went through 2 other leather covers before getting this made for me. I've had it 6 years or almost daily use and it still looks pretty good though I should probably treat the leather a bit.

Note, I only really right on the right side of a note book for regular notes leaving the left side blank so the pen case on the front doesn't impact my writing. The left side I use for when I've got an action I can go back and make updated notes in more detail so not used as frequently. [removed] Very interesting, thank you. I write clinical notes at work and would love a nice pen but struggle to keep a biro longer than a day! I know this sizers strange - but a lot of people say that time flies. Enjoy the Moment, you Never know when it‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôre doing something. Tonight you‚Äôre changing diapers, tomorrow you need to pick them up drunk and crying from some :-D I usually just write my favorite darkest secret. Like ""I use old bic ballpoints when I'm not farming reddit karma."" Raden are small colored pieces of Abalone shell ~~from some sea creature (forgot the name)~~. Iirc they have to be collected and applied by hand, which drives up the price.
edit: and to fix the pieces it is laquered with several layers of clear Urushi. You're mistaken. Capless pens still come with the 18k gold nib. I don't think Pilot sells a VP/Capless without a gold nib. The Platinum Curidas nib is steel. Oh no! That scenario sound like a disaster :-D
Im glad my wife is not in this hobby with me. Good luck to the both of you, I can only imagine that it‚Äôs probably pretty awesome to be in this hobby together!!
Also - are the Falcons those with rather flexy nibs? Yeah, I‚Äôve heard other people say the same. But having 3 TWSBIs and having been not too much impressed with two of them I‚Äôll definitely be trying the next one before I buy another. 
And yes, 2.6 is huge. I think it only makes sense for this nib to create headings, Christmas or birthday cards and maybe to practice some calligraphy. It‚Äôs not at all suitable for daily use :-D. But hell, I live in Germany and Kaweco stuff is really cheap here, so the nib cost me 9‚Ç¨, so it doesn‚Äôt hurt my wallet too much. Oh, the texture of the link black looks like it would feel sooooo good. 
Thx for explaining the difference to me. I feel like I‚Äôm Europe the Decimo models are rather hard to come by I think you‚Äôre right with this. I do love the others versions (especially the Raden designs), but this one looks and feels like it was made for me and my needs. It will form the trinity with my other similar-finish pens, the Lamy 2000 and the Faber-Castell Ambition. 
Usually I‚Äôm more of the colorful person but there‚Äôs a reason classic designs have been around for so long, I totally agree with you Ah! Thank you!!! This is great news. I will probably still be cautious though :-D As you said it‚Äôs tried and tested. How long have these pens been around? I think like from the 70s or so. Maybe I should just stop worrying. 
It‚Äôs good to know they have great after-sales service. Thank you for your insights. So. Very. Appreciated. ?üòä Oh yes.... i dread looking at that list :-D it‚Äôs soo long. Oh I think I still have a sample of Carbon Black somewhere. Good call! The twist mechanism is very nice. Retraction is a fast snap back if you let it, unlike the new VPs. Well, at least your wife lets you use her pens :-)
Thank you very much!! Sorry ?üòÇ Yeah, I think that‚Äôs mostly normal procedure with this pen since it‚Äôs a bit different to clean than a non-retractable fountain pen. More work for the clerks ?üòÇ
So: I really love the pen - now. 
Because at first I was a bit afraid the retraction mechanism would wear out soon because at my job I mostly write for maybe a signature, a check mark or a quick number. I thought I would click this pen maybe 200 times a day and that couldn‚Äôt be good. Therefore I only used it sparsely. But since like two months it‚Äôs been my daily driver besides my Lamy 2000 and it shows no signs of wear - both on the matte finish and the mechanism. It still clicks as great as on the first day I used it. So it‚Äôs really perfect. 
Also at first I was a bit worried that the clip would get in the way or make it uncomfortable to use. But since you‚Äôve already held it you know that this is nonsense. It‚Äôs surprisingly one of the most comfortable pens I own. 
Recently though it had some hard starts but I‚Äôm pretty sure that that‚Äôs due to the new ink I‚Äôve put in (L‚Äòartisan Pastellier Callifolio Botany Bay, a great blue/black-grey/black), because that wasn‚Äôt an issue before. 
The con-40 is something you‚Äôll have to live with. Me personally, I like switching inks often so I don‚Äôt mind not being able to get a full fill of the converter. But then again - you could also use cartridges. 
It‚Äôs a rather heavy pen but I really like that. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt have to ‚Ä?force the pen to remain seated correctly in your hand‚Äú, if you know what I mean. 

Solid solid pen and definitely a recommendation from me. And that‚Äôs coming from a guy that was first very sceptic regarding the design of the pen. Since I‚Äôve begun using fountain pens I started hating ballpoints with a passion. And let‚Äôs be honest, the VP reminds me a lot of a ballpoint. But it‚Äôs so convenient with the best of both worlds: the convenience of a ballpoint and the usability and comfort of a fountain pen. 
It‚Äôs not a cheap pen so I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve held it already before pulling the trigger 
The medium nib I got is juicy and of the perfect width for both signatures and daily writing/journaling. 
It was a Love that had to grow but now I‚Äôm head over heels. 
There‚Äôs definitely a reason why so many people love it. And you should give it a shot, my friend. Oh I see, thank you for the link. That would be great for me, too. I use LT1917 as well, you know, for journaling. I use both sides though. So maybe I need to get another Galen product, maybe a zippered folio to be able to take out the pen holder, let‚Äôs see. 
I found out yesterday evening that the VP is not really much bigger that my Lamy 2000, so that‚Äôs much less of an issue than I thought. 
But I‚Äôll check out your link more thoroughly later today. Thank you so much!! ....... yeah, I hope you make those people aware that it‚Äôs completely possible to stab someone ‚Ä?with your pen‚Äú even when the nib is retracted :-D Oh man, then I would go with a cheaper pen, I guess :-D
If you don‚Äôt mind I could recommend you something else: 
TWSBI has the ‚Ä?Go‚Äú Models. They cost around 20 bucks and have a huge ink capacity. Since they are filled with pushing a button and letting it go the filling is easy and you don‚Äôt Need s Converter or anything else. Just ink and the pen. So pretty low cost. 
Why I especially recommend this particular pen is that it has a snap cap (so fast note taking is possible without needing to screw the cap off)  and the snap cap has a small ‚Ä?hole‚Äú in it, where you can put a Thread or a string through it. This way you can carry the pen around your neck which will reduce the risk of losing it significantly :-) maybe you want to try this first [deleted] Abalone is the name I had no idea that the raden works are held in place with urushi lacquer. That explains the price. I have an 845 that I adore and I think the prices are justified based on my understanding of the ""Roiro"" process of laquering. Is it the same process with the raden pens? Just curious... I must be going insane.  I could have sworn there was a $80 Pilot Capless with a steel nib.  Was it discontinued?

Edit: Yeah, I can find them on Amazon. The nice part is that she doesn't find the hobby to be silly or a waste of money, the downside is that, since I make the majority of the money for the household, I am expected to deliver some goods during the holidays and anniversaries :p

Also yes, the falcon is the model that comes with the oddball nib that is supposed to be fairly flexible to start, though I know the most famous YouTube videos tend to be of nibs that have had additional meister-adjustments to make them even more flexible.  The normal falcon isn't terribly expensive,  pretty close to the cost of a VP actually, bit it isn't big enough to support the con 70 converter, and is made of resin.  Call me a snob, but if I am paying $180 for a gold-nib pen, I want it to have a metal body, and the ability to take a larger converter too makes the $240ish price tag of the metal falcon worth it to me.

All of this said, I haven't actually held a falcon in my hands to know if I even like the nib feel, but all of the research I have done points to it being something I like.  I just wish covid would let up so I could travel to try one before I buy! Oh wow I can see why then :D 1963 apparently, although the design has had some changes. 
https://www.cultpens.com/news/q/date/2019/05/17/pilot-capless-retractable-fountain-pens I really appreciate the detailed and thought out response mate, and the time you've given. 

Looking forward to my NPD post, hopefully some time soon! Ok I wanna know how Not the same, as far as I know the VP raden is basically abalone shells with clear urushi. Roiro is more labour intensive (this the difference in price between lets say the Namiki Urushi #20 and the VP raden). Also, roiro wouldn't work if what you want is to display the abalone shells. I don't know a lot about Raden pens. Heck, I don't even own one (yet (hopefully)). I just recall they use Urushi laquer as sort of finishing layers. But on the cheaper Pilot models there sure are fewer layers than on some high-end Nakayas. Although Urushi itself is not an inexpensive material, the main cost comes from the labor intensive work of individually cutting and placing the Abalone shell bits. That's also why the Pilot Capless Raden Galaxy is much cheaper than the Water Surface: former has very little pieces ""sprinkled on"", unevenly distributed, latter has big pieces all the same size. I doubt any Raden pen would be much cheaper if they used another laquer.

Also don't know what Roiro is, sorry. After looking around, apparently there were/are some available in Japan. The latest references I see to them are from 2017. But none of the UK or US retailers I've looked at stock them. I know exactly what you mean. I have been the sole breadwinner for the last two years, my wife has just started working again (thank god), so the situation slowly relaxed recently. 
And yes, I‚Äôd probably also prefer the metal over the resin body!
I wish us all luck with the COVID Situationskomik that you can try this one soon. Especially with ‚Ä?experimental‚Äú nibs like the falcon one it would definitely make sense to try it first. You‚Äôre so welcome ?üòä and thx for the award!! You‚Äôre awesome! 
Looking forward to your post [deleted] My guess is 1 pencil and 0 fountain pens I knew I wasn't crazy.  I think it even used to be sold in the US.  Not 100% sure about that.  Either way, it's not widely available anymore. The package is waiting for me at home as I type! Can't wait, currently watching the clock here at work haha I did the same, but I only got 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 lead, enough to last me around 5-6 years I think. I have my eye on a few mechanical pencils but unless I get the perfect pencil from GvFC (which I won't unless I win the lottery) my FP/ink purchases far exceed my pencil/lead purchases. No, you aren‚Äôt crazy. 
Generally VPs and Capless (same pen, different name) are sold with 18k gold nibs. They are either gold or rhodium plated gold, both 18k. 
But if you look at the pensachi page for example, you can find those with a ‚Ä?special alloy‚Äú nib and those are not gold nibs and the pens are cheaper. 
But I think that if a pen has one of those special alloy nibs the product description will probably tell you :-) Awesome!! I‚Äôm so happy for you. You‚Äôll have a great time with it - now good luck killing time until you get home ?üòÇ?üòÇ";626;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jqx5zp;fountainpens;"NPD: my grail (for now) arrived. The Pilot Capless (vanishing point) Matte Black in medium. I‚Äôm shaking - months of saving and waiting and I‚Äôm so happy!!!  I see you‚Äôre doing the classic ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to write so I‚Äôm going to write about writing with my fountain pen because I just want to write something.‚Äù Just looked this up. What is the difference between the 156.00 and 800.00 dollar versions. Beautiful but holy cow Very sleek! The grey ink is a nice match too! Congrats! As a very happy owner of multiple Pilots, I'm always going back and forth on whether I'll eventually have a Vanishing Point as a grail pen. Glad you're enjoying it so much!! Congrats on the grail acquisition! Is the ""Capless"" branding something regional, or is this distinct from what I'd see in the US as a Vanishing Point?

In any case, I have LOVED my VPs for literally decades. Great pens, great daily drivers. You won't be sorry! They‚Äôre good pens. I think they are particularly well suited to use at work and for note taking. They‚Äôre great when you need to use the pen one handed and may be frequently uncapping and recapping. Plus the soft nib has an enjoyable bounce to it. 

I don‚Äôt head to work meetings without mine. Fuyu shogun is my fav ink haha, can recognize it straight from your writings I love my vanishing point. Absolutely incredible pen. I rarely use anything else Congratulations.  It‚Äôs a stunning pen, do enjoy. Congrats!  Very similar situation on my end--just landed a new job (yes, even in this current climate) and, after a year and a half of waiting, pulled the trigger.  Loving my VP for work and home!  My true ""grail"" is a homo sapiens, but that is still wayyy down the list of financial priorities lol Congrats on a grail achieved! Saving up and sacrificing makes attaining something even more special. Enjoy it, you deserve it The finish shines up over time instead of wearing off in patches (which was my fear). It gives it a nice patina without looking shabby. If TWSBI hadn‚Äôt spoiled me for unnecessarily large ink capacities, my VP would still be my daily driver. No worries, If you get the chance try out a stub nib on it at some point. The Vanishing point stubs are one of my favorite stubs to write with! Congrats! My VP and my Decimo are my favourite pens! It's beautiful! I love how sleek the matte black looks That is particularly nice in that Matte Black. Congrats on the grail acquisition! I sold off my stealth VP and I regret doing so.... great pen. This is my favorite every day writer. I have two. BE CAREFUL! They dent EASY!! 
[Dent Picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/NfkyLHo) Isn't it great!? I got the pink one last week and I love it! 

Your strokes look crisp, what are you writing on here? I'm still looking for loose paper that doesn't bleed or feather under the medium nib. Beautiful pen! Great choice, I love my VP (M). It‚Äôs my main work pen!! Enjoy! The Vanishing point in matte black was my first big pen purchase too and I still use this bad boy as an everyday writer for work and what not to this day! I have the d√®cimo vp in red. I love it. Such a convenient edc. And I also have been using the fuyu-syogun a lot. It's almost replaced black for me. Almost. I got this bad boy in a stub. One of the few I always have inked. [deleted] I've been thinking of buying Pilot capless for a moment now. You just make me want to buy it. But I have to relax. I'll wait until I get into school again. Bought my matte blue vanishing point (fine) a few weeks ago and couldn't be happier!!! Congrats! Congrats! This pen is so good. This was my daily with a fine nib, but now ( today ) I started with a Lamy 2k Medium. That is my dream pen, is it amazing? Please tell me its awful. That's a beautiful pen. Congratulations.  
I hope I can buy one soon. Congrats ! Hey mate, I played with this exact pen at a store today and am now needing it in my life. How have you found it several months on?? https://i.imgur.com/NgPlNVC.jpg 

Hey Pen Buddy. You‚Äôll love the Vanishing Point / Capless! Get some Pilot Iroshizuku ink and you‚Äôll be set (for now). The bottles are sooo nice.

Or Emerald of Chivor ink which is currently on my wish list. [removed] And as it happens, you are now infected with the Fountain Pen Bug.....enjoy!! May I ask do you write a lot to warrant such expensive (but absolutely really cool) pens, or is it just a hobby? Genuinely interested Seriously, I was in between work and changing the diaper of my little one. So I could have written about financial accounting principles of the governmental building industry or the color of the poop I would be cleaning a few minutes later. So Im kinda happy by my choices here :-D 90% of my journals are writing about my writing and wanting to write and how I write and when I want to write again. Some people may not want to share anything personal on reddit I‚Äôve almost forgotten that a person can write about anything else Yes, as others mentioned there are really some works of art out there plus the ones that have a different retractable mechanism. There is also the Fermo which has a twist mechanism as far as I know. [deleted] Thank you. I‚Äôm a sucker for grey inks and this is my favorite. It‚Äôs fuyu-syogun from the Iroshizuku line by Pilot Yes, well, Pilot is it for me, too. They‚Äôre great pens and the convenience of this one sold it for me Thank you so much!! Yeah, it's the same pen just with different branding. VP is the cooler name IMO, but Capless feels very professional (which might be why the branding is different). Yes, that‚Äôs why I got it. It will probably be my go-to pen for work besides my 2000. understated design and great writing experience <3 It‚Äôs just my favorite, hands down. Distinct, classic, not boring and well behaved. What else could I want? Yes, I can definitely see that in my future as well :-D Thank you so much!! Congrats on your new job and your new pen!!! Yes, the HS is a grail for me too, it looks awesome. But it‚Äôs like 4x the Price of this one so even if I could afford it I probably could not justify it. I have a kid and that‚Äôs my financial priority so maybe a Van Gogh for me :-D but go at it and tell me how you liked it. I can enjoy it vicariously Thank you so much!! Yes, this marks a very special day in my book. Being fully able to afford it according to budget and being patient.... people are right when they say delayed gratification is the best! Yeah, it‚Äôll be interesting seeing this pen age, I‚Äôm so curious. Also I like to change inks often so c/c pens are my jam. I can see though why the large piston fillers definitely have their place :-) Thx for the recommendation. I‚Äôve yet to test the waters with stubs. Have an Eco-T with a stub nib and this thing is awfully scratchy and not at all a pleasure to write with. So if I‚Äôd get another stub nib, I‚Äôd want to try it before buying. 

Oh, wait, I have...like... a 2.6 (or 2.9?) Kaweco stub which is awesome. Maybe the Eco one was just a bad one Thank you! Is the difference in size very notable between these models? Oh yes. Saw it a couple of months ago and knew it had my name on it :-) Yes, i think so, too. It‚Äôs really a no-nonsense design this way - though I‚Äôm not saying the other designs are nonsense. Far from it. 
I do think though that this is a safe option. 
A person would likely grab a more fancy looking pen from my desk rather than this one....I hope Thank you so much!
And yes, sometimes it‚Äôs that way. Some years ago I sold my record collection. Over 700 records, some were really obscure and hard to come by metal releases and editions. I have all those records on my hard drive, but it‚Äôs almost 12 years since and I still regret it. 
But dude, there‚Äôs still the possibility of getting a replacement of this particular pen :-) Oh noooooo. I‚Äôm so sorry :-/ I promise to be careful!! Oh i love it! Congrats to yours as well :-) I can definitely see why you love it. 
To be honest, it‚Äôs copy paper I just grabbed from the office to take home since I‚Äôm in remote work for this week. 
I think the manufacturer is Mondi (I think they‚Äôre a European company) but I can check that with my colleagues in my office tomorrow if you like :-) Thank you very much. Yes, I can see and feel why you love yours so much :-) Thank you! Did you experience some kind of wear-out with the click mechanism? That‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm a bit worried about. Ha! I was deciding between a red one and the matte black. I can see we have similar taste. 
I‚Äòm still on the lookout for ‚Ä?my‚Äú black. I have Onyx black and Quartz black from Diamine.... but they‚Äôre not ‚Ä?my‚Äú black. I have to try Take-Sumi and Aurora black. People swear on those. What do you recommend? me too. And a Fermo in medium. Is it possible to get a replacement nib unit Asia stub? The Shops I‚Äôve been looking at only had fine, medium and broad <3 I‚Äôm so sorry. But you, you‚Äôre probably right and I think you‚Äôll even be happier when you‚Äôve waited with your purchase. Hell, I‚Äôm the best example for this Oh!! Congrats to you, too, pen buddy. This is awesome, I think we have years of great fun and usability ahead of us :-) Thank you so much! 
I have the 2000 in medium, too - that was a birthday gift from my dad. So this will have a special place in my heart anyways. But it helps that the 2k is such a fantastic pen. Have fun with it. I guess you will very much love it by the end of this day :-) It‚Äôs totally awful. The Click mechanism is rather hard to press, I didn‚Äôt expect that. 
Also: it‚Äôs just black. How boring is that?
It said the nib would be 18k gold. It‚Äôs not even gold! It‚Äôs silver, WTF!
The nib is way too smooth and man, this thing looks like a ballpoint when retracted. Who TF would want that??

Sorry, I can‚Äôt go through with that. It‚Äôs really amazing and worth keeping it as a grail pen. You won‚Äôt regret a single moment with it. Thank you very much! Fingers are crossed - you won‚Äôt regret it Thank you so much!! Short version: get it. It‚Äôs worth it. It really is. 
Sorry, am in a hurry, I‚Äôll write a more detailed answer tonight, if that‚Äôs okay for you ?üëç?üèª Oh my, thank you! 
Yes, I‚Äôve inked mine with Iroshizuku Fuyu-Syogun, which is one of my top 3 inks (Alt-Goldgruen by R&K and KWZ Maroon being the others) and it is just great!
By the way, what case are you using for your VPs btw? They seem so long that I have to yet find a solution to this. 
Oh, and EoC is a great ink, I‚Äôm more of a shading guy. I see the appeal though and the bottles look like very expensive perfumes <3 Thank you for the heads-up and the advice, especially in regards to cleaning!
I do hope though that the pen will develop some character over the years. Pictures of this model as beat up and used.... man, those have something to it! Oh, i have been for a while now, but this still is a milestone for me. Thank you so much!! Yes, you may, of course. 
I would not consider myself a heavy writer. All in all I think I write about 1 to 1,5 hours a day. This includes journaling and work. 
I‚Äôve had some mental health issues beginning of the year (nothing really serious but not good, either) and noticed how writing and especially journaling helped me focus more and be happier. So with that background I‚Äôm very happy to reward myself from time to time. And since I do 99% of my writing with fountain pens I thought that this particular pen purchase was definitely a good choice since I would benefit from it in several ways. 
So yes, maybe there are People out there that write a lot more than I do. But writing keeps me sane, organized, focused and happy. And I‚Äôm very happy to spend that kind of money this way for me :-) 
I won‚Äôt lie, though. This price for a pen feels like my limit. Even if money wasn‚Äôt an issue, I could not see myself spending like 500$ on a pen. But those thresholds are differ for different people This feels close to home, that's exactly what I am doing right now. [deleted] Thank you. Confirm raden water surface pen on gouletpens.com 
I‚Äôm now considering a vintage one on eBay for around 120. Exactly. That name just changes depending on sales region AFAIK I was under the impression that the VP had a gold nib and the Capless does not.  Am I mistaken? Thanks!  To make things even more complicated, the HS is also my wife's grail pen (specifically the magma for her) so when I finally do get one for myself, I probably need to have money set aside to get her one too before too long lol.  In the meantime, my ""next step"" pen is a metal falcon with a con 70 though... The ecos do have that issue with their stubs if you want to try a smooth 1.1 stub, try the Twsbi 580 diamond stub or the vac700 r stubs those are buttery smooth and even more so with a well lubricated ink like something from noodlers! And wow 2.6 is huge! I've yet to try a stub that big haha In the hand they do feel different, the Decimo is noticeably lighter and thinner. I see it as my dainty version of my VP - I have it in champagne pink and with an EF nib :) my VP is the 2020 Link Black version with a fine nib. being a real fan of great looking pens, I find yours very special in its classic look and sleek design.  I much prefer the matte finish on this pen.  A shiny lacquer would make the pen too ""busy"". None thankfully I've had mine for almost 3 years now (3rd year coming up in dec) and have had no issues with the mechanism! It is a very tried and tested design, I wouldn't worry too much about reliability. I haven't had to find out, but Pilot has a good reputation for after-sales support. The best black I have used is platinum carbon black. It's good, but not quite there for me. I have not tried the aurora black. I'll have to add it to my ever growing list of Inks to buy. How is the twist mechanism? The fermo Model really looks so awesome, like straight from another galaxy <3 Both the VP and the 2000 are my wife‚Äôs I just ‚Äúborrow‚Äù them LOL. Hope you enjoy the Pilot! Well I grudgingly admit I'm glad its not awful. ;) No that's super awesome, thanks ! 

It felt great in the hand, but they wouldn't let me try it out haha I have a custom made notebook holder with a 2 pen case attached to the front of it made by ([https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/StrideRidge?ref=usf\_2020](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/StrideRidge?ref=usf_2020)). I wanted a plush leather cover to hold my Leuchtturn1917 notebooks and I ask the maker to attach one of his leather pen cover holders to the cover (as you can see in the pic).  The cover fits perfectly over my note book, has 3 custom slots for business cards on the inside, the back flap has a slit in it to allow for the enclosure band to still work and allows me to access the gusseted pocket on the back cover.

I went through 2 other leather covers before getting this made for me. I've had it 6 years or almost daily use and it still looks pretty good though I should probably treat the leather a bit.

Note, I only really right on the right side of a note book for regular notes leaving the left side blank so the pen case on the front doesn't impact my writing. The left side I use for when I've got an action I can go back and make updated notes in more detail so not used as frequently. [removed] Very interesting, thank you. I write clinical notes at work and would love a nice pen but struggle to keep a biro longer than a day! I know this sizers strange - but a lot of people say that time flies. Enjoy the Moment, you Never know when it‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôre doing something. Tonight you‚Äôre changing diapers, tomorrow you need to pick them up drunk and crying from some :-D I usually just write my favorite darkest secret. Like ""I use old bic ballpoints when I'm not farming reddit karma."" Raden are small colored pieces of Abalone shell ~~from some sea creature (forgot the name)~~. Iirc they have to be collected and applied by hand, which drives up the price.
edit: and to fix the pieces it is laquered with several layers of clear Urushi. You're mistaken. Capless pens still come with the 18k gold nib. I don't think Pilot sells a VP/Capless without a gold nib. The Platinum Curidas nib is steel. Oh no! That scenario sound like a disaster :-D
Im glad my wife is not in this hobby with me. Good luck to the both of you, I can only imagine that it‚Äôs probably pretty awesome to be in this hobby together!!
Also - are the Falcons those with rather flexy nibs? Yeah, I‚Äôve heard other people say the same. But having 3 TWSBIs and having been not too much impressed with two of them I‚Äôll definitely be trying the next one before I buy another. 
And yes, 2.6 is huge. I think it only makes sense for this nib to create headings, Christmas or birthday cards and maybe to practice some calligraphy. It‚Äôs not at all suitable for daily use :-D. But hell, I live in Germany and Kaweco stuff is really cheap here, so the nib cost me 9‚Ç¨, so it doesn‚Äôt hurt my wallet too much. Oh, the texture of the link black looks like it would feel sooooo good. 
Thx for explaining the difference to me. I feel like I‚Äôm Europe the Decimo models are rather hard to come by I think you‚Äôre right with this. I do love the others versions (especially the Raden designs), but this one looks and feels like it was made for me and my needs. It will form the trinity with my other similar-finish pens, the Lamy 2000 and the Faber-Castell Ambition. 
Usually I‚Äôm more of the colorful person but there‚Äôs a reason classic designs have been around for so long, I totally agree with you Ah! Thank you!!! This is great news. I will probably still be cautious though :-D As you said it‚Äôs tried and tested. How long have these pens been around? I think like from the 70s or so. Maybe I should just stop worrying. 
It‚Äôs good to know they have great after-sales service. Thank you for your insights. So. Very. Appreciated. ?üòä Oh yes.... i dread looking at that list :-D it‚Äôs soo long. Oh I think I still have a sample of Carbon Black somewhere. Good call! The twist mechanism is very nice. Retraction is a fast snap back if you let it, unlike the new VPs. Well, at least your wife lets you use her pens :-)
Thank you very much!! Sorry ?üòÇ Yeah, I think that‚Äôs mostly normal procedure with this pen since it‚Äôs a bit different to clean than a non-retractable fountain pen. More work for the clerks ?üòÇ
So: I really love the pen - now. 
Because at first I was a bit afraid the retraction mechanism would wear out soon because at my job I mostly write for maybe a signature, a check mark or a quick number. I thought I would click this pen maybe 200 times a day and that couldn‚Äôt be good. Therefore I only used it sparsely. But since like two months it‚Äôs been my daily driver besides my Lamy 2000 and it shows no signs of wear - both on the matte finish and the mechanism. It still clicks as great as on the first day I used it. So it‚Äôs really perfect. 
Also at first I was a bit worried that the clip would get in the way or make it uncomfortable to use. But since you‚Äôve already held it you know that this is nonsense. It‚Äôs surprisingly one of the most comfortable pens I own. 
Recently though it had some hard starts but I‚Äôm pretty sure that that‚Äôs due to the new ink I‚Äôve put in (L‚Äòartisan Pastellier Callifolio Botany Bay, a great blue/black-grey/black), because that wasn‚Äôt an issue before. 
The con-40 is something you‚Äôll have to live with. Me personally, I like switching inks often so I don‚Äôt mind not being able to get a full fill of the converter. But then again - you could also use cartridges. 
It‚Äôs a rather heavy pen but I really like that. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt have to ‚Ä?force the pen to remain seated correctly in your hand‚Äú, if you know what I mean. 

Solid solid pen and definitely a recommendation from me. And that‚Äôs coming from a guy that was first very sceptic regarding the design of the pen. Since I‚Äôve begun using fountain pens I started hating ballpoints with a passion. And let‚Äôs be honest, the VP reminds me a lot of a ballpoint. But it‚Äôs so convenient with the best of both worlds: the convenience of a ballpoint and the usability and comfort of a fountain pen. 
It‚Äôs not a cheap pen so I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve held it already before pulling the trigger 
The medium nib I got is juicy and of the perfect width for both signatures and daily writing/journaling. 
It was a Love that had to grow but now I‚Äôm head over heels. 
There‚Äôs definitely a reason why so many people love it. And you should give it a shot, my friend. Oh I see, thank you for the link. That would be great for me, too. I use LT1917 as well, you know, for journaling. I use both sides though. So maybe I need to get another Galen product, maybe a zippered folio to be able to take out the pen holder, let‚Äôs see. 
I found out yesterday evening that the VP is not really much bigger that my Lamy 2000, so that‚Äôs much less of an issue than I thought. 
But I‚Äôll check out your link more thoroughly later today. Thank you so much!! ....... yeah, I hope you make those people aware that it‚Äôs completely possible to stab someone ‚Ä?with your pen‚Äú even when the nib is retracted :-D Oh man, then I would go with a cheaper pen, I guess :-D
If you don‚Äôt mind I could recommend you something else: 
TWSBI has the ‚Ä?Go‚Äú Models. They cost around 20 bucks and have a huge ink capacity. Since they are filled with pushing a button and letting it go the filling is easy and you don‚Äôt Need s Converter or anything else. Just ink and the pen. So pretty low cost. 
Why I especially recommend this particular pen is that it has a snap cap (so fast note taking is possible without needing to screw the cap off)  and the snap cap has a small ‚Ä?hole‚Äú in it, where you can put a Thread or a string through it. This way you can carry the pen around your neck which will reduce the risk of losing it significantly :-) maybe you want to try this first [deleted] Abalone is the name I had no idea that the raden works are held in place with urushi lacquer. That explains the price. I have an 845 that I adore and I think the prices are justified based on my understanding of the ""Roiro"" process of laquering. Is it the same process with the raden pens? Just curious... I must be going insane.  I could have sworn there was a $80 Pilot Capless with a steel nib.  Was it discontinued?

Edit: Yeah, I can find them on Amazon. The nice part is that she doesn't find the hobby to be silly or a waste of money, the downside is that, since I make the majority of the money for the household, I am expected to deliver some goods during the holidays and anniversaries :p

Also yes, the falcon is the model that comes with the oddball nib that is supposed to be fairly flexible to start, though I know the most famous YouTube videos tend to be of nibs that have had additional meister-adjustments to make them even more flexible.  The normal falcon isn't terribly expensive,  pretty close to the cost of a VP actually, bit it isn't big enough to support the con 70 converter, and is made of resin.  Call me a snob, but if I am paying $180 for a gold-nib pen, I want it to have a metal body, and the ability to take a larger converter too makes the $240ish price tag of the metal falcon worth it to me.

All of this said, I haven't actually held a falcon in my hands to know if I even like the nib feel, but all of the research I have done points to it being something I like.  I just wish covid would let up so I could travel to try one before I buy! Oh wow I can see why then :D 1963 apparently, although the design has had some changes. 
https://www.cultpens.com/news/q/date/2019/05/17/pilot-capless-retractable-fountain-pens I really appreciate the detailed and thought out response mate, and the time you've given. 

Looking forward to my NPD post, hopefully some time soon! Ok I wanna know how Not the same, as far as I know the VP raden is basically abalone shells with clear urushi. Roiro is more labour intensive (this the difference in price between lets say the Namiki Urushi #20 and the VP raden). Also, roiro wouldn't work if what you want is to display the abalone shells. I don't know a lot about Raden pens. Heck, I don't even own one (yet (hopefully)). I just recall they use Urushi laquer as sort of finishing layers. But on the cheaper Pilot models there sure are fewer layers than on some high-end Nakayas. Although Urushi itself is not an inexpensive material, the main cost comes from the labor intensive work of individually cutting and placing the Abalone shell bits. That's also why the Pilot Capless Raden Galaxy is much cheaper than the Water Surface: former has very little pieces ""sprinkled on"", unevenly distributed, latter has big pieces all the same size. I doubt any Raden pen would be much cheaper if they used another laquer.

Also don't know what Roiro is, sorry. After looking around, apparently there were/are some available in Japan. The latest references I see to them are from 2017. But none of the UK or US retailers I've looked at stock them. I know exactly what you mean. I have been the sole breadwinner for the last two years, my wife has just started working again (thank god), so the situation slowly relaxed recently. 
And yes, I‚Äôd probably also prefer the metal over the resin body!
I wish us all luck with the COVID Situationskomik that you can try this one soon. Especially with ‚Ä?experimental‚Äú nibs like the falcon one it would definitely make sense to try it first. You‚Äôre so welcome ?üòä and thx for the award!! You‚Äôre awesome! 
Looking forward to your post [deleted] My guess is 1 pencil and 0 fountain pens I knew I wasn't crazy.  I think it even used to be sold in the US.  Not 100% sure about that.  Either way, it's not widely available anymore. The package is waiting for me at home as I type! Can't wait, currently watching the clock here at work haha I did the same, but I only got 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 lead, enough to last me around 5-6 years I think. I have my eye on a few mechanical pencils but unless I get the perfect pencil from GvFC (which I won't unless I win the lottery) my FP/ink purchases far exceed my pencil/lead purchases. No, you aren‚Äôt crazy. 
Generally VPs and Capless (same pen, different name) are sold with 18k gold nibs. They are either gold or rhodium plated gold, both 18k. 
But if you look at the pensachi page for example, you can find those with a ‚Ä?special alloy‚Äú nib and those are not gold nibs and the pens are cheaper. 
But I think that if a pen has one of those special alloy nibs the product description will probably tell you :-) Awesome!! I‚Äôm so happy for you. You‚Äôll have a great time with it - now good luck killing time until you get home ?üòÇ?üòÇ";;
I decided to buy myself a high school graduation gift to make up for me not having one lol. Here‚Äôs my test drawing using my new pilot vanishing point matte black with watermans intense black;;"Great pen (and a great drawing). Congratulations! Welcome to the club, I bought myself my first real fountain pen, a Parker 75 Cisele Sterling Silver with a 14 Kt gold nib, when I graduated from high school... in 1979!  My collection has grown a bit since then! I‚Äôm about to be a senior and got into the hobby mid sophomore year with a pack of pilot varsities (and a little later a LAMY Safari) I recently got a vanishing point as it is my grail pen and I have loved it ever since. All my friends laugh at me until we have to write a long essay in class and my hand isn‚Äôt all cramped by the end of the essay. Congratulations, OP! When did you get into fountain pens? I ask because I'm also a graduating senior, and I got into fountain pens this year. I looked back in your history to the Jinhao and I have to say your art is fantastic!

Welcome to real pens, OP! how does one draw with pen Congrats from another graduating senior! I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm completely torn on whether or not to treat myself to a new pen or watch. My favorite EDC Congratulations! And enjoy your new pen, hopefully in college or pursuing some other ambition. 
  
Love my VP with a medium nib. What did you go with? You‚Äôre very talented. I love your kitty sketch!
Congratulations on your graduation too by the way ?üòä Excellent choice. Damned impressive there. I am always blown away by the talent shown in fountain pen drawings. *1000th upvote woot woot!*

Holy moly! You've got some talent! And congratulations on graduating!!

Edit: dang.. who would downvote this? Talented and beautiful pen. This pen looks so suave, and the drawing is so deftly drawn! Pen is absolutely fantastic and the Waterman Noir Intense is a decent ink depending on paper.

Hope you get lots of good use out of it <3 Congrats on graduating! That looks amazing! That is a fantastic drawing. Nice one, love it :) Very nice!! You made that vanishing point sing ?ü?∂ As you grow older, you will more likely prefer gifts you buy yourself. Deep Darkness This is fabulous art! Would you call your technique crosshatching? Congrats on graduating! I just bought myself the exact same pen, which I had been wanting for years. Mine was a reward for caring for my mom, who has dementia, for 4 years. My first pen was a blue Lamy Al-Star. Love the kitty! Congratulations!!  Great Choice you have a Great eye. Hope it reminds you of accomplishment for years to come. Beautiful, and congratulations. That, is a really nice sketch. Great technique and execution. This is fantastic! Congratulations on your graduation We‚Äôll done!!! Definitely my new fav Ah nice pen! I intend to grow my collection quite a bit in coming years! Yeah I bought a safari as my first an have been hooked since! Having a nice pen just makes writing so much nicer I bought my first one at the start of my final year so 6-7 months ago Thank you! I am excited to have a real pen lol A lot of confidence in your decisions and an idea of what you want to draw beforehand pretty much. Takes a lot of practice Idk how to draw with anything. A pen is the last thing I *personally* would draw with. Maybe my finger in some sand. Graduate to a pencil and then crayons when I'm feeling myself. Pen (fountain pen!) would be last on my list. OP is a total badass. Both great choices! I am going into an art school so a pen was a natural choice for me lol I got a fine nib on mine. And I‚Äôm heading into an art program so it‚Äôs going to get a lot of use Why thank you Congrats on graduation. Good pen choice. I bought a VP with medium nib two months ago and have no regrets. Carry at work in my shirt pocket as EDC.

Very nice sketch too:) Haha thanks I‚Äôve started to notice that and intend to buy myself quite a few lol Thank you! What pen is the one showed here? Congratulations on Graduation. Can confirm. Just started practicing and it is.... difficult. Plus sides are your errors are painfully evident so I thought that was helpful.

Hat tip to you on a beautiful specimen.

Edit: very nice use of lines and pen control!!! Ah, I‚Äôm going into an engineering program and think it might be neat to have a little feat of engineering right on my wrist. Awesome. Best of luck! 
  
I have a Sailor with a Fine nib, so mixed it up. But I like that I can order an additional nib unit and easily swap it out in the VP. Eventually may go with an architect grind for it.

The pilot vanishing point is the greatest pen of all time.;"I have 2 Ecos, 2 metropolitans, a preppy, a Peter pen narwhal, a diamond 580, and that Black Forest garbage Amazon tricked my family into buying me. 

So needless to say, I‚Äôm an expert.

Edit: forgot my lamy safari (which in my opinion is easily forgettable ?üòú)";"Love my VP ?üò§ (click click click click) Click click gang!!!! It's okay. I like it, but have no desire to get another VP. The writing is good, but the feel of it in my hand is just okay. 

The Pilot Custom Heritage 912 (14k SFM) and the Justus 95 (14k F) are more my speed. [deleted] I love the idea of the VP, but the clip... the clip. Just can't get used to it. Had a VP, gave it away. Only ""nice"" (e.g. >$40) pen I've given away to date.

Now, make me a clipless VP and I'll be first in line (or possibly 2nd... definitely close behind u/anyaplaysfates at the very least) to get one. I have been a fan for a long time (1997), but fell out of using them. I appreciate the convenience, but discovered the joys of flexible and soft nibs, which just aren't a thing in the VP line.

However, I did just pick up an LS model, and it's kind of rekindled the love. The new clip placement is less annoying (I preferred the faceted plastic model's clip), and the silent mechanism is very cool. I do enjoy the VP F nib, very precise, and just a touch of feedback. Can‚Äôt agree there. Scratchy/toothy nib. It‚Äôs one of my least favorite pens. I have a $30 Twsbi that, to me, is tenfold a better pen than the Vanishing Point. I have the special alloy VP and love it, but it‚Äôs got nothing on my pilot elite or 823 (except the convenience of course - unbeatable there). Saying this not to disagree with you but rather to pressure you toward some more amazing pilot nibs I‚Äôm the future! Enjoy your pen! [deleted] Sorry but far from it. The VP is a great pen, but a gimmick. The Myu or M90 are better Pilots. The Lamy 2000 will always win the daily category, and a Meisterstuck will always be the greatest pen ever. At its price point, probably. I love my Aurora, MB 149, and Omas. Love the black forest! Fude nib is the way to go. 

(I've never tried a VP so can't speak to that, but had to defend the black forest.) Click-click!

Although, I do wish the converter held more ink‚Ä¶ I love mine! I‚Äôve had it for 11 years. Pilot actually repaired it for me once. Still love. Use it pretty much daily (and yes I have a *bunch* of other fountain pens) Not to put you down but that collection doesn‚Äôt make you an expert lol Now why would you call Black Forest garbage, it's got the best fude nib out of all the ones I've tried so far. Fude nibs are bent nibs for creating a brush effect when writing kanji/ Chinese characters.  I liked Black Forest so much i bought a second and likely to buy a 3rd because it works so well with my light pastel inks. You should have added ‚Äújust my opinion‚Äù after your comment‚Ä¶reason being, there are just waaaaaay too many F.P.‚Äôs in the world for you to make such a distinction‚Ä¶(of course‚Ä¶that‚Äôs just my opinion)
Respectfully,
Jeff Mercer
Mentor, Oh. Eh ... gripping the clip is ... an acquired taste to say the least.

I will say its a great pocket pen.

It won't leak or wreak havoc there ?ü§î In my humble opinion it is a pretty dang good pen. Well made, heavy and it‚Äôs a clicky fountain pen. However something about it just dosent agree with the way I write. I have a fine and it‚Äôs super smooth. But the clip being there and the tiny short nib‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just not comfortable for me. I prefer my Lamy dialog cc so much more. Granted it‚Äôs no where in the same price range as the VP and it‚Äôs extra fine nib writes more like a Japanese medium (I plan on sending it out to mike masuyama next week to have it ground down to a proper Japanese fine) Goins jumo in m?üòÇ Lots of in depth comments which I truly appreciate but for me a VP is simply something that stands out above carrying a ballpoint to use as an edw. I have several vanishing points and for me it was so amazing that a click pen with such a lil nib could write do well and had so much flexibility compared to a standard ball point pen.I think it‚Äôs very popular since honestly for that size nib it writes pretty damn amazing and is easily interchangeable. That little click bait got me into so many fountain pens since it is really a stepping stone in my opinion. I will never not be excited about the pilot VP since it was one of the first fountain pens I actually used. ?ü•∞ [deleted] I bought a Majohn and found it was a very smooth writer. But, I made the mistake of not using it for around a week or two (too many shiny pens inked *lol*) and I discovered that the entire Pilot cartridge I had installed had leaked inside the pen. It seems like there is a bad crimp seal around the breather hole.  One of the YouTube reviewers fixed his leaking pen by putting silicone grease in this area but not in the breather hole.  I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try it on the nib unit that came with the pen. 

To tell you the truth, I don‚Äôt mind the clip, so I‚Äôm going back to my trusty VPs. I have one of the original faceted models from the 90‚Äôs, the Aquamarine one from a few years ago and a prized Raden Galaxy model.

Click click I do love the click-click instant use and often reach for my VP first for that reason! I also love the springy nib, and mine is a smooth writer. However, the clip placement really bugs me! It‚Äôs also not the most exciting pen to look at.

I would definitely buy a clip-less VP in a more exciting design. Pilot(e) pass.

I think the Fermo has a better mechanism. I like the additional weight too. One of my first ‚Äúnot cheap‚Äù pens and I hate it.  At the time I had mostly ef pens, so I got a fine. And I hate it. Scratchy, hardstarts, you name it. A few months later I discovered the joy of medium nibs, so I got a broad nib for the vp. Same issues. It hasn‚Äôt come out of the drawer in almost a year now. I do love my vanishing point but if I had to pick a best pilot for every day use I‚Äôd have to go with the myu. It hasn‚Äôt left my rotation since I got one and the vanishing point has. 100% disagree. It's only my second favorite pen I own, not the first.

It's my daily carry outside of work. Nice pen indeed. I just wish the converter weren't so small. Click, click click... so great! I agree with the poster for work related use.  the convenience of jotting down items rather than long writing sessions can't be beat.  the clip is a bit annoying but for short writing sessions no biggie.  not having to cap and uncap is key.  get it with a fine nib and paper/notebook quality a non issue.

for longer writing sessions, I'm a montblanc fanboy.  146 and 149 for the win. VP is awesome! I have the VP, Decimo, LS, and Fermo I really love the nail feel behind the pen it‚Äôs smooth and feels stiffer than most gold nibs(at least mine but most of mine are sailor), and the click gives you such a sense of power! Does a Decimo count? I love my VP and decimo even more (I have smaller hands!). I went to the pen guy on Monrovia before he passed away and he showed me his favorite FP, black VP. I was hooked. I'm one of those people with the weird grip which makes writing with my VP awkward. I still pull it out from time to time to see if I can use it yet, but I just can't get into it. Sucks because I really think it's a great pen. I ended up going for a dialog3 because the VP got me into retractable fountain.

There is a mahjon clone of the vanishing point that comes in clipless I thought about getting. It would be great if the internals were interchangeable because the nib writes so smooth. Can anybody comment on that actually? I'm looking to buy one. Fine or medium? I have small handwriting so I'm leading towards fine. But maybe medium will look nicer when signing documents? I just got my VP and along with my Lamy 2000 and Pilot Falcon I feel like I now have all my bases covered. It's nice to have something that can ride in my shirt pocket that I can take out to quickly underline a passage in a book or make a quick note without fussing with a cap. Is it a goodpen, yes. Is it the greatest pen? No. You've only tried 6 type of pens. That is far from enough to experiment enough pens to make a statement like that. I'm at 120 and it's not enough for me to say which is the greatest pen Each to their own. Beauty as they say is in the eye of the beholder. I personally find the VP really ugly and have no
Intention of ever getting one. My VP is my most used pen by far but it ain‚Äôt the greatest pen of all time. Not even close. It is a tank of a pen and takes some abuse. It is handy, which is why it‚Äôs my carry pen. But it has a larger diameter than I like, it‚Äôs quite a heavy pen, and the clip can be awkward when writing. 

It‚Äôs an amazing pen for on-the-go, but I rarely use it at a desk. Simply put - every other pen I own is more enjoyable to write with for me. I'd agree that it's the best pen you have, but it's no where near the greatest pen of all time. I don't even think it is the best pen currently made by Pilot. [deleted] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3EzRAgjo_s 823? >that Black Forest garbage Amazon tricked my family into buying me.

It's not a bad pen, unless you get a bad one. It was my first fountain pen, that my wife bought me as a ""gag."" The nib that came on mine was shit. I've replaced it with a working nib and it's really a cool pen for the price. And before I got it working, it had me looking for better fountain pens, which I wouldn't have been shopping for otherwise, so... anyway.

Glad you like your Vanishing Point a lot, though. It's not for me, but that's why it's great that there are so many different pens out there and they are all so different! It's only useful for the click.

The nib, despite being gold, has little to no flex. It also has a very small ink reservoir and a very poor air seal.

So if you're not specifically hunting for a click pen, then there are much better choices. What makes you love it?
And I agree, lamy is really forgettable. The pen only has very few issues, it's just... The design and the fact that it's THE fountain pen the average person finds out about? For me it's just Boring. I never use mine

Maybe because I was an idiot and bought a neon green one xD If you like the VP, you may like the VP Fermo (a twisting variation of the VP) too! I absolutely love the VP but I may like the VP Fermo a little more. The nib units are also interchangeable! >I have 2 Ecos, 2 metropolitans, a preppy, a Peter pen narwhal, a diamond 580, and that Black Forest garbage Amazon tricked my family into buying me. *(and Lamy Safari)*  
>  
>So needless to say, I‚Äôm an expert.

Kind of a limited sample pool there just saying :D 

That being said, I've had three vanishing points (black and blue carbonesque, and a fermo) as well as the Moonman A1 clone of it without the clip. 

For me they're just 'ok', well built and all, but much prefer something like the Parker 45 if I'm going to have a no-frills ready to write workhorse pen, even though it's not a capless. It's sort of a inexpensive alternative to the Lamy 2000 for the same points. 

If for some reason I need a capless it'll be a Pilot G2 gel pen. I‚Äôll have to check them out! 

I was nervous about the size/weight of it when I ordered, and of course the clip location. So far I‚Äôve got no issues but then again I‚Äôve yet to go on a particularly long writing session with it. Honestly, absolutely nothing. It writes better than my preppy and worse than my metropolitan, which is right for the price. It is arguably more comfortable in hand as well- though not as much as my ecos.

I like it more than my safari actually! (Which I just realized I failed to list)

It‚Äôs just tough to put too much stock in the first result for ‚Äòfountain pen‚Äô when you search Amazon. Majohn A1 is your choice. There is clipless version of that pen. And parts are swappable between Majohn and Pilot I have yet to try a flexible nib. I have to say, when I bought the VP with a gold nib, I expected something much more flexible and soft. 

Everything I have is steel, so this was really just a smoother version of what I‚Äôm used to. So I‚Äôm certainly not disappointed with the reality, but I‚Äôve still got something left on the checklist! I‚Äôve heard this as a common complaint, particularly with the fine-er nib sizes. 

I got a fine with the 18kt gold nib and it‚Äôs been super smooth. The closest competitor I‚Äôve got is the TWSBI diamond 580, which even then is a long way off. Both my ecos are super scratchy comparatively.

What nib size did you get, and what material? Just curious if this is a quality control issue or personal preference, since pilot is generally well accepted as putting out great nibs. Meanwhile I've had nothing but negative experiences with TWSBI - weird how some pens just don't work for some folks are you referring to the e95s or vintage pilot elites? I just got a Moonman a1 but boy do I want a vintage pilot elite ef I‚Äôll take a look if I can put my hands on one in a pen shop around. 
The convenience is a major factor for me, as I don‚Äôt always have the flexibility in the hospital to unscrew a cap every time I make a quick note.

Still, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm done looking for quality drawing/writing pens for home!  Very interesting both your preferences were pilots as well! 

And totally, that clip is extremely polarizing. Personally I‚Äôm not bothered by the ‚Äòupside down‚Äô appearance, and for some reason the overall look appeals to me. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but I can say I needed to buy the matte black. The glossy bodies didn‚Äôt appeal to me, which is why I never considered the decimo very seriously. Finally! I expected plenty Lamy 2000 mentions in here and this is the first yet. 

I respect the conviction, and will be sure to refute you once my bank account allows. (Or fall in line...) After looking them up, the aurora is absolutely beautiful, and I can say the same for the omas. 

At some point I need to add a montblanc to my collection, or several really. 

If only I could rob a bank...

The pen is mightier than the sword but probably not the federal government. I don‚Äôt have the fude nib and am drawing a blank on what that means in terms of size. I believe mine is either a medium or a fine.

I think the only gripe I found with it was the body would unscrew itself on occasion with use. I‚Äôd be willing to bet this was user error on my part, but either way I found myself gravitating towards the TWSBI line. I‚Äôd amend my post to vouch for it more strongly, but opted to do so in the comments here and above instead. (Can‚Äôt complain about a little more traffic, a little more conversation)

But yes. It is a surprisingly good pen in my experience. I‚Äôm glad it has some loyalty around here! I certainly like it far more than the Lamy safari, and just look at how popular that thing is. > Although, I do wish the converter held more ink‚Ä¶

I really wish Pilot would get their shit together with their converters. I go for piston fillers for the most part so I can avoid dealing with converters, but man, the converter situation is really bad with Pilot. I‚Äôve had to resort to keeping a stash of refilled cartridges with me daily, as this gives about 30-200% more capacity, depending on what converter you‚Äôre using. 

Definitely something you should consider Great to hear! I‚Äôm hoping to be able to say the same one day. I‚Äôve only had it for a short time and am already dreading the day I need to get something fixed. For the moment, it is the closest thing I have to a ‚Äògrail pen‚Äô

I‚Äôve heard pilots customer service is great, even after your warranty has run its course (3 years maybe?)

I would love to know what has changed about it since your initial purchase. The most I know of is the paint job formulation being adjusted for the matte black chipping issues. It was very much a joke so no offense taken at all ?üòÇ Nice to hear someone else appreciates it. I had no idea this was a good use case for a fude nib, but it makes sense!

Mine came with a standard fine or medium nib and writes just fine, especially for the price. I did have a couple times where just regular use would unscrew the body somehow, but it‚Äôs likely that was my fault. 

I‚Äôm glad a few of you are so passionate about it! I like it far more than my initial post states, but I have to admit I haven‚Äôt inked it in a long time. Just found myself gravitating toward TWSBI. Heck, even my metropolitans aren‚Äôt inked any more, and they‚Äôre great writers as well. I disagree. Of course it‚Äôs an opinion, it couldn‚Äôt be anything else. My described collection and joke regarding my expertise also emphasizes my inexperience with many high quality pens. Describing it as my opinion would have been redundant, in my opinion ?üòâ.

The goal for this post was to pull people in and discuss if they agree, disagree, and what they would propose to be superior. I would say it had done exactly that.

So any way, what would you choose as the greatest pen of all time? Yeah I get it. Good to hear you gave it a shot though from the sound of it! Can‚Äôt say I would be inclined to change my grip for just one pen, regardless of the convenience. Especially so considering how many options are out there, waiting to be added to the collection. Price is definitely still a factor for me. I had to tell my wife the VP was ‚Äò$40 gifted by a family member‚Äô... a half truth at best. (Family gave me $60 ?üòÇ)

If you still got yours, maybe give gripping a bit closer to the nib/slightly below the clip a try! It‚Äôs the sweet-spot for me in terms of writing performance, without particularly hindering comfort. 

The dialog is a fantastic looking pen though. Very stream-lined to me. Absolutely! It really packs a punch. It‚Äôs a shame they haven‚Äôt put out a clipless model yet, as I wonder how many people would join the bandwagon.

Are there better writers out there? No doubt, of course. But for now this thing holds a special place in my heart. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre going to love it! And absolutely. I have to make sure I always know where it is in on my person, which just becomes second nature at a certain point. 

Be sure they don‚Äôt leave it at a nurses station or anywhere besides their body or bags! As sad as it is, even doctors steal. And don‚Äôt get me started on the psych wing! Great pens, and glad to hear you gave the A1 a shot. I‚Äôd like to down the line, though I may wait to see if some of these production issues get resolved first. If they do, pilot may be in for a run for their money! Check Majohn A1 out. There is a clipless model. And it‚Äôs 100% interchangeable with Pilot capless pens. For some reason I didn‚Äôt particularly consider the fermo before purchasing my VP. 

It‚Äôs a great looking pen and I have to take your word for the mechanism. I don‚Äôt think I would be inclined to much more weight, but who knows. 

As silly as it sounds the fermo looks a bit too professional (?) for my taste at the moment. I can‚Äôt quite say what it is, but I respect it I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. My assumption is that it‚Äôs an issue with how it fits your hand/grip and not so much mechanical (since I‚Äôm assuming you changed the entire nib section, and not just the nib itself)

I‚Äôve been wrong before and I will again- but maybe give it a shot with gripping it closer to the nib than you‚Äôre naturally inclined to! I imagine it won‚Äôt be the difference maker, but hey, if this can make a currently worthless pen usable, it‚Äôs worth a shot. You should send it in for repair.  Something's wrong with it.  They'll fix it. Thinking out loud, as you may not recall which ink you were using. The few times I‚Äôve had anything like that happen with a VP is when the ink just wasn‚Äôt the right match. I‚Äôve been using some noticeably dry inks lately, and they don‚Äôt bother me, because I love them that much. But a couple of them, even when used with a wetting agent, just were not going to work in a VP or Decimo with a F or EF nib unit. At no point have these nibs ever been scratchy for me, but the F/EF nib units are extremely fine, and the ink choice matters. For that matter, even when I purchased a few M nib units that were vastly ultrasmooth in terms of writing experience, the Tag Keshimurasaki ink just wasn‚Äôt going to work in that pen, so I moved on and inked it with Iroshizuku Ajisai, and the results were perfect. Now this makes the third mention of the myu, so it must be worth its weight. This pen looks absolutely fantastic. I‚Äôd have to give it a good try if the opportunity arises... You‚Äôve got to give refilling cartridges a chance, and maybe that would change your mind.

With that said- what‚Äôs your most favorite? I‚Äôve got to know now! It‚Äôs like a pod of dolphins in here! Hahaha Can‚Äôt wait for the day I can say I have a montblanc in my pocket. But yeah that convenience is huge. I went fine for this exact reason you listed- I can have all the high grade paper I want at home, but when at work... you best bet they got the cheapest stuff they could! Wow! That is essentially the whole line as I know it! Excluding capless of course, but hardly needs to be included considering the minute differences. The LS is very interesting, though for now I think it places last on my list of potential future purchases in the ‚Äòcapless‚Äô category- the fermo is at the top! I was shocked with how satisfying the click is, particularly when retracting the nib. It really punches back! 

Also, I am eager to get some more experience with gold nibs in the future, especially ones with a degree of flex. I think I‚Äôll have to allow it. 

Personally I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the glossy bodies, otherwise I would have gone for it!

If I had the chance to see one in person as opposed to window shopping online, I very well could have a different opinion. Very similar story to what sparked my initial interest in them!
I‚Äôve got to give the decimo a try one day. For now, the gloss is a bit too flashy for my use cases.

Small hand gang has to stick together! Haha You are 100% correct, they are interchangeable!
Happy to hear you like the pen though, bad luck with the grip. 
The Dialog is a great pen as well! I went fine because all my daily users are EF, and I like to be able to sketch with it a bit. Also, I typically write on normal, low quality copier paper at work. I was concerned the increased flow would be an inconvenience there.
I‚Äôll certainly get a medium as well in the future.

I‚Äôd suggest starting with the medium if you‚Äôre intentions are purely for writing and you most frequently use high quality paper.

If you‚Äôre in a low paper quality work environment, and you want to be sure you can use this pen comfortably there, I‚Äôd go with the fine.

The above is a link to a writing sample by Goulet pens which demonstrates the difference between each nib size! 

Good luck That is exactly my use case for the VP, as well as just regular writing at home as it‚Äôs definitely my best pen overall. 

Great lineup though! I‚Äôve heard solid things about the lamy 2000 performance, but based on my experience with the safari I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever go for it without getting a chance to try it before purchasing. Agree and disagree. I think if you bought the top 20 most highly praised pens, across a massive survey, you‚Äôd be able to make a pretty decent guess. 

But yes, I was in fact joking about my ‚Äòexpertise‚Äô

Edit: what‚Äôs your favorite of your bunch? +1. This comment is at -1 right now. I hate when people downvote a comment made in good faith. At least, comment with your counter argument. I agree. The matte black is the best looking in my option but still what I would politely call an ‚Äúacquired taste‚Äù. That said, the bounce of the nib is amazing. Well, can‚Äôt argue with that!
What is your favorite? Fair enough. I‚Äôm still in the honeymoon stage with it so for now it remains my go to even at home. I‚Äôm curious to see if this will last- I do love the feel of my diamond 580 and the narwhal even. 

The metropolitans I got very early on, so the adjustment in weight and barrel wasn‚Äôt much for me to notice nowadays. 

For the moment it is the most bang for the buck I‚Äôve got, but if I can remember this post in a few years, perhaps I‚Äôll update you with my new preferences! After all, there is still a whole gold nibbed world for me to explore one day... Totally fair! What would you choose? I was wondering if I should expect some wear from the click mechanism itself. 

For me, the clip is totally fine and nonintrusive- but it is an absolute killer for a lot of others. Totally understand. Love it! Hahaha Absolutely. I left my comment in the initial post but proceeded to sing it‚Äôs praises in the comments. It is a surprisingly good pen, and a fantastic starter pen (barring bad luck).

Glad it got you to join the hunt! [deleted] The air seal has served me well so far, but totally fair ciriticism that the main appeal is the click. 

One day I‚Äôll have the parkers and pelikans, heck even pilots that will prove this post wrong... but for now it‚Äôs great! 

It‚Äôs all perspective. Would love to hear what you would choose as the best pen out there. People really love their safaris. A very passionate bunch. 

To me it was almost dead on arrival. The nib on it reminded me of my platinum preppy, and I got a matte black one which was a mistake. The white I gifted to a family member was much nicer looking. But yeah- all in all, I did not like the nib or enjoy writing with it in the slightest. To each their own!

For the VP, a huge part is the convenience. I‚Äôve also had a great time getting into tinkering with cartridge refills and storage etc, as all my other pens have a decent capacity with either piston fills or converters. Also, the writing is far smoother than my other pens, besides maybe my diamond 580. The body shape and look of the matte black has also really appealed to me, which is interesting since all of my favorite pens are demonstrators. I‚Äôve got to get my hands on a fermo I‚Äôm the future to feel it out. I didn‚Äôt consider it to be honest! The twist got overwhelmed by my pull to the click. 

If only I had other buddies who were into ‚Äòwasting‚Äô their money away on fountain pens... haha! The G2 is an absolute classic from my school days. My favorite.

And yes you‚Äôre absolutely right about the small sample size ?üòÇ. With any luck I can add a pelikan, Parker, moonman, montblanc... etc, in time. 

Mainly I‚Äôm just excited this VP is a tier (or several) above my other pens, though I do love my 580. 

I‚Äôve heard mixed opinions on the VP vs the Lamy 2000, though people love to compare them. Two very strong camps there. 

Thanks for the reply! For the price it‚Äôs hard to beat. Plus the looks are great. It doesn‚Äôt write as good as the metro I agree. Interesting‚Ä¶ I may have to research further! This is true so far as I know- though from what I‚Äôve heard the majohn dries out after a couple days. So unfortunately even swapping the bodies for the clipless Majohn would cause trouble. 

Happy to be proven wrong though Former Statement has been corrected Put a Pilot Custom 912 FA on your list!  Awesome pen. Ha, no it doesn‚Äôt work that way with gold nibs, especially in a Vanishing Point or Decimo. You might want to look at the Falcon, or a Custom 74 from Japan, which gives you more flexibility about different nibs that aren‚Äôt available on the Custom 74s that are sold in the United States. >I have to say, when I bought the VP with a gold nib, I expected something much more flexible and soft.

As you found out Gold does not automatically mean soft/flex so don't even try to press them they're not made that way. 99% of the nibs out there be it gold or steel is going to be firm and not intended for any pressure. (even the semiflex/flex that you are more likely to come across from say 1920s pens of certain brands/models \[some are very firm, some are soft, same kind of mix\] aren't going to have that crazy start-end range that people expect when they hear 'flex', just easier to do). 

It's also a myth that gold is smoother, the tipping material used on both gold and steel nibs are a super hard metal alloy, and not steel or gold, the smoothness is also dependent on the shaping and texture of that tip not the base metal of the rest of the nib. Course if you don't have a tipping on a gold nib, it'll smooth out really quick, but you'll wear it down to a stub in a matter of months (hence why nibs are tipped, as even steel will be smooth and wear down in a few years of regular usage if not tipped).   


Fact is, steel nibs can be just as smooth and wet, but most manufactures out of the factory tend to put more attention/finishing on their higher end offerings when they can give the same polishing/shaping treatment to their other nib materials, likewise a nibmeister can perform that same service for about $20 on any material of nib as the tipping is basically the same. Even Pilot can put out a bad nib once in a while. Although it's rumoured that if it happens several times in the same year than the entire production line has to commit sepuku.

..But a lot of Westerners today simply can't use a fine or extra fine Japanese nib. Or sometimes not even a medium. They use too much pressure and blame the pen. Japanese kids grow up writing with O.3mm pencils - those leads have about a third of the strength of what westerners think is a fine pencil lead. The Jowo nibs on twsbis are designed for people used to ballpoints. Most Japanese nibs, definitely not. Looooooooove scratchy/toothy!!!!! Totally fair. I have one TWSBI Eco that‚Äôs relatively smooth, another that is absurdly scratchy with strokes from right to left, which I like least. Otherwise I love the pens- probably mostly for the demonstrator aesthetic. 
Fun to fill the white with red ink and have it look like a syringe in the hospital. The black has bay state blue, so it‚Äôs like a bruise in my mind...

In reality both inks are too dark so you can barely tell, but hey- at least I know. >Meanwhile I've had nothing but negative experiences with TWSBI - weird how some pens just don't work for some folks

It's called QC. I have the current-day elite/e95s, but straight from Japan, where it‚Äôs still got ‚ÄúElite‚Äù written out instead of the E in the US market, so I sometimes use both names interchangeably. I, too, want a vintage one though! A lot of people like the Majohn A1... I feel that 100%. As a teacher, my VP is one of my most-carried pens so I can take quick notes, stop, and start whenever is needed. OMG, right?  There's no excuse for that to still be a problem after 100 freakin years of manufacturing. I always keep mine in a sleeve when not used, so I don‚Äôt have any issues with the paint. One of my friends does, but he says it adds character :) My pen stopped closing all the way (I noticed that the ink was drying out) so I sent it to Pilot and they fixed it. Haha my collection only has 3 brands so I can‚Äôt talk either [removed] The white pearlescent body is still pretty good looking so I may swap a VP unit into it. I don‚Äôt know. Not feeling like messing around with it right now. 

Click click Thank you! I shall! Could be an issue with the trap door mechanism, which is complex and has multiple modes of failure.  If it doesn‚Äôt close properly, the pen will hard start.

I find the trap door requires more maintenance than i want to give it.  My Capless goes mostly unused.  I just use snap-cap pens which are almost as easy and easier to maintain. It‚Äôs probably one of my favorite pens overall regardless of use case so I‚Äôd definitely recommend trying one if you can. How pilot made a steel nib that good I don‚Äôt know

That being said getting that chance can be kind of a pain it‚Äôs one of those pens where the pricing gets silly pretty fast I really should do that at some point. I don't know why I haven't.

My favorite pen and my best writer in a Noodler's Ahab. It's proven itself to be excellent in a LOT of different ways. It has it's quirks, which always makes me wary of suggesting it to new people, but I haven't had a pen yet that writes better, is more durable, more repairable, more eco-friendly, or more flexible in day to day use. It advertises it's low-price flex nib, but honestly I rarely flex. That just gives me a softer writing experience - which is very wet and super fine. I use it with 54th Massachusetts ink right now, which tends to have a lot of spread in my other pens, but even though it's wet, the fine line handles it great. It's finer than my Pilot VP with a pilot fine nib. yes....fine or extra fine helps with cheap paper.....F/EF lets me use moleskines too with little bleed to the back of the paper.

you didn't ask but the best notebook I found for fountain pens has been leuchterm";;;;;;
;;;;;;....about same price as moleskine but far superior quality.;;
;;;;;;;;
; but I use it cap off and mostly at home so pretentious to myself maybe.  the writing experience is superior and distinct.  worth the time and effort to save. The Fermo has to be my favorite of the bunch. Such a neat twist mechanism and it just sucks the nib right back in.  The only other one I want is a Vintage Namiki Faceted. They are so very cool looking; but also $500+ and more than I want to spend on another VP variation. Most gold nibs flex a little bit especially the sailor 21k nibs and they give a degree of line variation but gold nibs are not made for a lot of pressure on them like actual flex nibs tho the best you get is maybe one size up example: Fine to a medium. But they have a lot more springy and smooth feel to them That's awesome. Ordering one now to try it in.;;;;montblanc is criticized as pretetious.....it probably is;;
;;;;;;There's no plan to make a clipless version is there? I need to take a look in ebay and see what options there are on the older models. ;;
; everything else I write with is at least med (non Japanese); nmf; architect; broad. Maybe the thin lines and low forgiveness make me think I'm just writing badly with it. I actually want the EF; but the store I was just looking at only had medium or fine.;Another thing that may affect my decision is the fine nib it has;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Its not often high quality paper for me. Usually Thinner paper. Occasional documents (thick paper).;;
;;;;;;;;
; it might be fun to use a VP for that.;;;;;I like the idea of sketching. I do sketch quite a bit. But I use pigment pens with all the various sizes. Still;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;I want the pen as a daily.;;
;;;;;;;;
; but I also had the nib custom ground by [Nibsmith](https://nibsmith.com/product/nib-work/) into a cursive italic nib that writes wonderfully. I happened to be at the right place at the right time at the opening of a new pen store where he was there doing free nib grinds on any pens $100 or more. Awesome ink capacity but it definitely has a sweet spot you have to hold it in to get the best results. I'd definitely recommend trying it first. Hard to choose. I really love my Pilot Myu. The design of the nib is special and it writes really well. Another one I really like is the Conklin mark Twain. But my daily writer is a Pilot Custom 74 in fine. Agreed Love that description. ?üòÇ;;;;;So now I'm leaning towards fine or EF hahaha skirted the initial question. Now I have to look for a place that has EF in stock... My L2K has been great;;
; especially because I know how polarizing the aesthetic is; but I just love it.;;;;I can‚Äôt put my finger on it;;
;;;;;;;;
; I would not stray from the matte black for some reason. My favourite pen is a Yard o Led Viceroy Grand in the Victorian Finish following by the modern Parker Duofold. I still recommend the pilot vp. I think it‚Äôs great. But my Kaweco Special; Diamond mini and pelican 200 are the pens I reach for first. I carry my VP in my pocket with a notebook for jotting notes so it sees quite a bit of use.;;;;Agreed though;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;When you‚Äôre ready for a gold nib my recommendation is to go vintage. I‚Äôve tried several modern ones and several vintage and the vintage ones are all smoother. My wonderful girlfriend tried a couple modern ones and was unimpressed. She preferred her TWSBI. I recently made a trade for a vintage Skyline. When I told her about it she just shrugged. I let her try it out and now it has a home in her pen case.;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Enjoy your new pen. Click click. [deleted] >Shape of a nib has a lot more to do with flex than material. The idea that gold nibs will/should flex is really a misunderstanding.;;
;;;;;;;;
; *all else being equal*; gold is softer than steel. You're tempting me to try a 580 but the thing I've found out about this hobby is that fountain pen related stuff have horrible quality control.;;;;Obviously we mean;;
;;;;;;It's almost like luck matters more than the pen.;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Makes me wanna try to make really accurate nib machines or make a type of nib less suspectiblr to issues That‚Äôs what all of us on this subreddit are here for! Whether friends‚Ä¶or enablers. Very fine line apparently. >though from what I‚Äôve heard the majohn dries out after a couple days;;
;;;;;;;;
; and it'll be least a few weeks before you start getting hard starts if you start to use it infrequently. Anything that gets harder start sooner would do the same in a Vanish point.;;;;;Had the Moonman (Majohn) A1 clipless before;;
;;;;;;;;
; is not make sure the trap door fully closes (which is usually the result of not putting in the cartridge/converter in fully). If that's popped open a tiny bit it's going to dry out pretty quickly be it the Pilot or the Majohn. I have a several of them and none of them dry out... even after 3 or 4 weeks of sitting unused.  Maybe they got a bad one.  They're actually almost as good as my VPs.  Don't hesitate to try one. Don‚Äôt have Majohn A1;" but I‚Äôve heard that pen needs a about a week to dry out :) Majohn did not """"take over"""" Moonman"; Moonman changed their english company name to Majohn after some really shitty behavior by Kaweco trying to interfere with their ability to do business in the west. Will do! Thanks for the suggestion! 2 things:;;;What some people tend to do;;
;;;;;;- it's 912 with an FA nib;;
; but if you want to flex; it just won't be adequate;;;;- it's awesome after you replace the feed with an aftermarket one (designed for the FA) as the stock feed is not well suited for western style writing. It would be ok for something like Spencerian;;
;;;;;;;;
; both traditional dip pens and quills; fountain pens with dip nibs; historic flex and semi flex pens; and modern soft nibs; flex nibs;I do have a relatively good selection of flex pens; but still outclassed by my VP. ;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;And I absolutely should have given more attention to the design of the pen itself- you can tell from the photos alone that the nib is not likely to exhibit much flex.;;
;;;;;;;;
; seeing as it‚Äôs so inexpensive as an entry point to that category. ..Then there are the needletip liquid ink pens designed for the Japanese market. I like the uni eye **ultra** micro; but it isn't even officially available in the UK. Some of these pens have a 0.28 ball; meaning they write a 0.14 line. By comparison; 0.7 and 0.9 balls are fine and medium for western office pens. > ..But a lot of Westerners today simply can't use a fine or extra fine Japanese nib. Or sometimes not even a medium. They use too much pressure and blame the pen.;;I think I‚Äôll give the ahab a chance soon as my first pen with a decent amount of flex;;
;;;;;;;;
;" and even now I don't really like it. It isn't because I use too much pressure either; I often have to apply more pressure to it than I'd like just to get a line out of it (though part of this is due to the paper).";;;;;I have the Custom Heritage 92 with the fine-medium nib. I had to spread the tines quite a bit to get it to do anything I could fairly call writing;;

; and I don't like it or use it nearly as much as I thought I would. Lesson learned. Do you have the source of the mass suicide? I had the same nib problem on a swipe. And the grip was poorly designed - annoyingly slippery. Nah; only 1 of my TWSBI pens had bad QC; the other I just plain don't get on with design wise Yeah- I wish I put less value into one users post about a drying out problem they had with it. At this point I feel I‚Äôm too far gone... I imagine you can only go comfortably from A1 to VP and not the opposite. Absolutely- that convenience is just something you can‚Äôt get out of many fountain pens! Hah! Fair. If only they could cram the con70 in there without making it a gargantuan of a pen. But yeah; pilot needs to sort out their converter options. Hey if those are pelican; montblanc;I wanted that pen so badly; it‚Äôs also not the most expensive in the world; according to:

; I was in a hurry and typed it wrong.  I know it's a 912; I've got 2 of them and the stock feeds are fine on both of them.  I've found most people change the feed right out of the gate without even using it with the stock feed. Noodler's and likewise FPR will give a great start-to-end line variation; but compared to most actual flex nibs they require an extreme amount of pressure to get those line variations.;;;Blessings! Sorry;;
;;;;;;;;
; something to keep in mind because the extra pressure can get tiring after a while; also the same degree of pressure would destroy most nibs intended for flex.;;;;Using the fpr ultraflex where they modified it does require less pressure to accomplish the same variation;;

; but at a certain point I need some line thickness! Hahaha Any tips for resolving it? I‚Äôve thought of trying to manipulate the nib myself; but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been bold enough to make a move. I use them both.  It's fine.  The nib on the A1 is steel so it's stiffer.  Other than that; it's pretty much the same.  Get one to carry at work.  You'll be able to carry an extra color like red or something.  Plus; it's nice to have a back-up.  You'll find they don't hold much ink. Definitely!;;I have pretty small handwriting;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Maybe I should go through some of the quirks though.;;
;;;;;;;;
; which out of the box is not great. A deep clean with hot soapy water helps; and the rest goes away with time and use (apparently it has to do with the machining oils used in production; and light will break it down over time).;;;The first is the smell;;
;;;;;;;;
; a very basic but wide clip; etc. The clear ahab absolutely will scratch and scuff with use. ;;;;The second is that it's not really a vanity pen. The nib is extremely utilitarian in design - just a stamp of noodler's ink and a long slit. No gold trim;;
;;;;;;;;
; but you gotta be intentional. It does post nicely enough though.;;;;;The third is that if you like how fast the VP can come out... this thing has some serious fricken threads on it. I don't remember the count of how many turns it takes to take the cap off;;
;;;;;;;;
; but the more you tinker the more you get both the benefits and drawbacks of tinkering. You don't need to tinker (other than a good deep clean at first use). And both of mine wrote just fine without any tweaking. Luckily; it and it's pretty cheap (As far as fountain pens go); so if you go through and screw something up somehow; it's mostly fixable cheaply as well. Noodlers sells a cheap flex nib for less than 20$; but I personally use Conklin flex nibs they‚Äôre qa isn‚Äôt the best but if you get a good pen it‚Äôll treat you well plus theyre bulkier and I like my bulky pens I didn't know the swap was a thing!

;;;;;;;;
; the Procyon feels closest to vintage - something like that Esterbrook; perhaps. And obviously; a fine; only moderately wet nib will write a long way - maybe 600 or 700m. I‚Äôll definitely give it a go. Thanks! All in all it sounds pretty appealing! I‚Äôve already tossed it in my kid for future purchases. ;;Vintage pens were drier too. Of the modern pens I've used;;
;;;;;;The smell is a funny quirk though the threading issue doesn‚Äôt concern me much. Sounds like a great purchase for a desk pen at home.;;
;;;;;;;;
; but one nib is on the poorer side. ;;;;;Thanks for the suggestion! Thank you! I‚Äôll keep it on my list. Totally valid. I‚Äôve loved my ecos;;
;;;;;;I did manage to get a replacement once for I think $5 (shipping cost from the factory). ;;
;;;;;;;;
; but my 580 is definitely a smoother experience than either. From an engineering standpoint it adds up 100%.;;;;;So yeah- I‚Äôve got one great eco and one on the weaker side;;
; several years ago; I bought an antique desk with somebody's collection of Duofolds included.  I wasn't into fountain pens then so I sold them all on ebay.  I'm still kicking myself!  I can't believe I did that.  I so wish I had kept them. Be forewarned; vast majority of vintage nibs do not flex. It's course easier to find in some 1920s and earlier when it was more common; but chances are ones you find in the wild are going to be pretty firm. ;;That A1 may be purchased in the near future... Amen‚Ä¶ Interesting!  Believe it or not;;
;;;;;;;;
; but some did also have manifold (super firm) nibs. ;;;;;So ideally if you're hunting vintage for the purpose of flex you have to know which brand/model combination to look for that typically had it. Those also tend to carry a higher price tag due to today's demand for it. A waterman 52 for example is known to have flex;;
;;;;;;;;
; but being a US made Balance it's not common for it to have flex (the Canadian made models on the other hand it was more common);;;;;My oversized Sheaffer Balance from the 1930s has a nice flexible fine nib on it;;
;;;;;;;;
; as were the 1950s Parker Slimfold and Duofold; but only the UK made ones.;;;;Likewise the 1950s Pelikan 140 were commonly sold with semiflex nibs;;
;;;;;;;;
; so it's not the only reason I like vintage. Makes sense. The best man at my wedding moved from China to the US when we were in middle school. We ended up roommates in college; and long story short he still wrote in mandarin (?...I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right phrasing) around his drawings. ;;;;Not a lot of my vintages have semiflex/flex;;
;;;;;;;;
; EF is good though.;;;;;The characters are pretty intricate. (both the language and his illustrations) It's a stress to write hanzi/kanji in Hobonichi's 3.7mm grid with a Japanese F;;

Edit: forgot my lamy safari (which in my opinion is easily forgettable ?üòú) Love my VP ?üò§ (click click click click) Click click gang!!!! It's okay. I like it, but have no desire to get another VP. The writing is good, but the feel of it in my hand is just okay. 

The Pilot Custom Heritage 912 (14k SFM) and the Justus 95 (14k F) are more my speed. [deleted] I love the idea of the VP, but the clip... the clip. Just can't get used to it. Had a VP, gave it away. Only ""nice"" (e.g. >$40) pen I've given away to date.

Now, make me a clipless VP and I'll be first in line (or possibly 2nd... definitely close behind u/anyaplaysfates at the very least) to get one. I have been a fan for a long time (1997), but fell out of using them. I appreciate the convenience, but discovered the joys of flexible and soft nibs, which just aren't a thing in the VP line.

However, I did just pick up an LS model, and it's kind of rekindled the love. The new clip placement is less annoying (I preferred the faceted plastic model's clip), and the silent mechanism is very cool. I do enjoy the VP F nib, very precise, and just a touch of feedback. Can‚Äôt agree there. Scratchy/toothy nib. It‚Äôs one of my least favorite pens. I have a $30 Twsbi that, to me, is tenfold a better pen than the Vanishing Point. I have the special alloy VP and love it, but it‚Äôs got nothing on my pilot elite or 823 (except the convenience of course - unbeatable there). Saying this not to disagree with you but rather to pressure you toward some more amazing pilot nibs I‚Äôm the future! Enjoy your pen! [deleted] Sorry but far from it. The VP is a great pen, but a gimmick. The Myu or M90 are better Pilots. The Lamy 2000 will always win the daily category, and a Meisterstuck will always be the greatest pen ever. At its price point, probably. I love my Aurora, MB 149, and Omas. Love the black forest! Fude nib is the way to go. 

(I've never tried a VP so can't speak to that, but had to defend the black forest.) Click-click!

Although, I do wish the converter held more ink‚Ä¶ I love mine! I‚Äôve had it for 11 years. Pilot actually repaired it for me once. Still love. Use it pretty much daily (and yes I have a *bunch* of other fountain pens) Not to put you down but that collection doesn‚Äôt make you an expert lol Now why would you call Black Forest garbage, it's got the best fude nib out of all the ones I've tried so far. Fude nibs are bent nibs for creating a brush effect when writing kanji/ Chinese characters.  I liked Black Forest so much i bought a second and likely to buy a 3rd because it works so well with my light pastel inks. You should have added ‚Äújust my opinion‚Äù after your comment‚Ä¶reason being, there are just waaaaaay too many F.P.‚Äôs in the world for you to make such a distinction‚Ä¶(of course‚Ä¶that‚Äôs just my opinion)
Respectfully,
Jeff Mercer
Mentor, Oh. Eh ... gripping the clip is ... an acquired taste to say the least.

I will say its a great pocket pen.

It won't leak or wreak havoc there ?ü§î In my humble opinion it is a pretty dang good pen. Well made, heavy and it‚Äôs a clicky fountain pen. However something about it just dosent agree with the way I write. I have a fine and it‚Äôs super smooth. But the clip being there and the tiny short nib‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just not comfortable for me. I prefer my Lamy dialog cc so much more. Granted it‚Äôs no where in the same price range as the VP and it‚Äôs extra fine nib writes more like a Japanese medium (I plan on sending it out to mike masuyama next week to have it ground down to a proper Japanese fine) Goins jumo in m?üòÇ Lots of in depth comments which I truly appreciate but for me a VP is simply something that stands out above carrying a ballpoint to use as an edw. I have several vanishing points and for me it was so amazing that a click pen with such a lil nib could write do well and had so much flexibility compared to a standard ball point pen.I think it‚Äôs very popular since honestly for that size nib it writes pretty damn amazing and is easily interchangeable. That little click bait got me into so many fountain pens since it is really a stepping stone in my opinion. I will never not be excited about the pilot VP since it was one of the first fountain pens I actually used. ?ü•∞ [deleted] I bought a Majohn and found it was a very smooth writer. But, I made the mistake of not using it for around a week or two (too many shiny pens inked *lol*) and I discovered that the entire Pilot cartridge I had installed had leaked inside the pen. It seems like there is a bad crimp seal around the breather hole.  One of the YouTube reviewers fixed his leaking pen by putting silicone grease in this area but not in the breather hole.  I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try it on the nib unit that came with the pen. 

To tell you the truth, I don‚Äôt mind the clip, so I‚Äôm going back to my trusty VPs. I have one of the original faceted models from the 90‚Äôs, the Aquamarine one from a few years ago and a prized Raden Galaxy model.

Click click I do love the click-click instant use and often reach for my VP first for that reason! I also love the springy nib, and mine is a smooth writer. However, the clip placement really bugs me! It‚Äôs also not the most exciting pen to look at.

I would definitely buy a clip-less VP in a more exciting design. Pilot(e) pass.

I think the Fermo has a better mechanism. I like the additional weight too. One of my first ‚Äúnot cheap‚Äù pens and I hate it.  At the time I had mostly ef pens, so I got a fine. And I hate it. Scratchy, hardstarts, you name it. A few months later I discovered the joy of medium nibs, so I got a broad nib for the vp. Same issues. It hasn‚Äôt come out of the drawer in almost a year now. I do love my vanishing point but if I had to pick a best pilot for every day use I‚Äôd have to go with the myu. It hasn‚Äôt left my rotation since I got one and the vanishing point has. 100% disagree. It's only my second favorite pen I own, not the first.

It's my daily carry outside of work. Nice pen indeed. I just wish the converter weren't so small. Click, click click... so great! I agree with the poster for work related use.  the convenience of jotting down items rather than long writing sessions can't be beat.  the clip is a bit annoying but for short writing sessions no biggie.  not having to cap and uncap is key.  get it with a fine nib and paper/notebook quality a non issue.

for longer writing sessions, I'm a montblanc fanboy.  146 and 149 for the win. VP is awesome! I have the VP, Decimo, LS, and Fermo I really love the nail feel behind the pen it‚Äôs smooth and feels stiffer than most gold nibs(at least mine but most of mine are sailor), and the click gives you such a sense of power! Does a Decimo count? I love my VP and decimo even more (I have smaller hands!). I went to the pen guy on Monrovia before he passed away and he showed me his favorite FP, black VP. I was hooked. I'm one of those people with the weird grip which makes writing with my VP awkward. I still pull it out from time to time to see if I can use it yet, but I just can't get into it. Sucks because I really think it's a great pen. I ended up going for a dialog3 because the VP got me into retractable fountain.

There is a mahjon clone of the vanishing point that comes in clipless I thought about getting. It would be great if the internals were interchangeable because the nib writes so smooth. Can anybody comment on that actually? I'm looking to buy one. Fine or medium? I have small handwriting so I'm leading towards fine. But maybe medium will look nicer when signing documents? I just got my VP and along with my Lamy 2000 and Pilot Falcon I feel like I now have all my bases covered. It's nice to have something that can ride in my shirt pocket that I can take out to quickly underline a passage in a book or make a quick note without fussing with a cap. Is it a goodpen, yes. Is it the greatest pen? No. You've only tried 6 type of pens. That is far from enough to experiment enough pens to make a statement like that. I'm at 120 and it's not enough for me to say which is the greatest pen Each to their own. Beauty as they say is in the eye of the beholder. I personally find the VP really ugly and have no
Intention of ever getting one. My VP is my most used pen by far but it ain‚Äôt the greatest pen of all time. Not even close. It is a tank of a pen and takes some abuse. It is handy, which is why it‚Äôs my carry pen. But it has a larger diameter than I like, it‚Äôs quite a heavy pen, and the clip can be awkward when writing. 

It‚Äôs an amazing pen for on-the-go, but I rarely use it at a desk. Simply put - every other pen I own is more enjoyable to write with for me. I'd agree that it's the best pen you have, but it's no where near the greatest pen of all time. I don't even think it is the best pen currently made by Pilot. [deleted] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3EzRAgjo_s 823? >that Black Forest garbage Amazon tricked my family into buying me.

It's not a bad pen, unless you get a bad one. It was my first fountain pen, that my wife bought me as a ""gag."" The nib that came on mine was shit. I've replaced it with a working nib and it's really a cool pen for the price. And before I got it working, it had me looking for better fountain pens, which I wouldn't have been shopping for otherwise, so... anyway.

Glad you like your Vanishing Point a lot, though. It's not for me, but that's why it's great that there are so many different pens out there and they are all so different! It's only useful for the click.

The nib, despite being gold, has little to no flex. It also has a very small ink reservoir and a very poor air seal.

So if you're not specifically hunting for a click pen, then there are much better choices. What makes you love it?
And I agree, lamy is really forgettable. The pen only has very few issues, it's just... The design and the fact that it's THE fountain pen the average person finds out about? For me it's just Boring. I never use mine

Maybe because I was an idiot and bought a neon green one xD If you like the VP, you may like the VP Fermo (a twisting variation of the VP) too! I absolutely love the VP but I may like the VP Fermo a little more. The nib units are also interchangeable! >I have 2 Ecos, 2 metropolitans, a preppy, a Peter pen narwhal, a diamond 580, and that Black Forest garbage Amazon tricked my family into buying me. *(and Lamy Safari)*  
>  
>So needless to say, I‚Äôm an expert.

Kind of a limited sample pool there just saying :D 

That being said, I've had three vanishing points (black and blue carbonesque, and a fermo) as well as the Moonman A1 clone of it without the clip. 

For me they're just 'ok', well built and all, but much prefer something like the Parker 45 if I'm going to have a no-frills ready to write workhorse pen, even though it's not a capless. It's sort of a inexpensive alternative to the Lamy 2000 for the same points. 

If for some reason I need a capless it'll be a Pilot G2 gel pen. I‚Äôll have to check them out! 

I was nervous about the size/weight of it when I ordered, and of course the clip location. So far I‚Äôve got no issues but then again I‚Äôve yet to go on a particularly long writing session with it. Honestly, absolutely nothing. It writes better than my preppy and worse than my metropolitan, which is right for the price. It is arguably more comfortable in hand as well- though not as much as my ecos.

I like it more than my safari actually! (Which I just realized I failed to list)

It‚Äôs just tough to put too much stock in the first result for ‚Äòfountain pen‚Äô when you search Amazon. Majohn A1 is your choice. There is clipless version of that pen. And parts are swappable between Majohn and Pilot I have yet to try a flexible nib. I have to say, when I bought the VP with a gold nib, I expected something much more flexible and soft. 

Everything I have is steel, so this was really just a smoother version of what I‚Äôm used to. So I‚Äôm certainly not disappointed with the reality, but I‚Äôve still got something left on the checklist! I‚Äôve heard this as a common complaint, particularly with the fine-er nib sizes. 

I got a fine with the 18kt gold nib and it‚Äôs been super smooth. The closest competitor I‚Äôve got is the TWSBI diamond 580, which even then is a long way off. Both my ecos are super scratchy comparatively.

What nib size did you get, and what material? Just curious if this is a quality control issue or personal preference, since pilot is generally well accepted as putting out great nibs. Meanwhile I've had nothing but negative experiences with TWSBI - weird how some pens just don't work for some folks are you referring to the e95s or vintage pilot elites? I just got a Moonman a1 but boy do I want a vintage pilot elite ef I‚Äôll take a look if I can put my hands on one in a pen shop around. 
The convenience is a major factor for me, as I don‚Äôt always have the flexibility in the hospital to unscrew a cap every time I make a quick note.

Still, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm done looking for quality drawing/writing pens for home!  Very interesting both your preferences were pilots as well! 

And totally, that clip is extremely polarizing. Personally I‚Äôm not bothered by the ‚Äòupside down‚Äô appearance, and for some reason the overall look appeals to me. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but I can say I needed to buy the matte black. The glossy bodies didn‚Äôt appeal to me, which is why I never considered the decimo very seriously. Finally! I expected plenty Lamy 2000 mentions in here and this is the first yet. 

I respect the conviction, and will be sure to refute you once my bank account allows. (Or fall in line...) After looking them up, the aurora is absolutely beautiful, and I can say the same for the omas. 

At some point I need to add a montblanc to my collection, or several really. 

If only I could rob a bank...

The pen is mightier than the sword but probably not the federal government. I don‚Äôt have the fude nib and am drawing a blank on what that means in terms of size. I believe mine is either a medium or a fine.

I think the only gripe I found with it was the body would unscrew itself on occasion with use. I‚Äôd be willing to bet this was user error on my part, but either way I found myself gravitating towards the TWSBI line. I‚Äôd amend my post to vouch for it more strongly, but opted to do so in the comments here and above instead. (Can‚Äôt complain about a little more traffic, a little more conversation)

But yes. It is a surprisingly good pen in my experience. I‚Äôm glad it has some loyalty around here! I certainly like it far more than the Lamy safari, and just look at how popular that thing is. > Although, I do wish the converter held more ink‚Ä¶

I really wish Pilot would get their shit together with their converters. I go for piston fillers for the most part so I can avoid dealing with converters, but man, the converter situation is really bad with Pilot. I‚Äôve had to resort to keeping a stash of refilled cartridges with me daily, as this gives about 30-200% more capacity, depending on what converter you‚Äôre using. 

Definitely something you should consider Great to hear! I‚Äôm hoping to be able to say the same one day. I‚Äôve only had it for a short time and am already dreading the day I need to get something fixed. For the moment, it is the closest thing I have to a ‚Äògrail pen‚Äô

I‚Äôve heard pilots customer service is great, even after your warranty has run its course (3 years maybe?)

I would love to know what has changed about it since your initial purchase. The most I know of is the paint job formulation being adjusted for the matte black chipping issues. It was very much a joke so no offense taken at all ?üòÇ Nice to hear someone else appreciates it. I had no idea this was a good use case for a fude nib, but it makes sense!

Mine came with a standard fine or medium nib and writes just fine, especially for the price. I did have a couple times where just regular use would unscrew the body somehow, but it‚Äôs likely that was my fault. 

I‚Äôm glad a few of you are so passionate about it! I like it far more than my initial post states, but I have to admit I haven‚Äôt inked it in a long time. Just found myself gravitating toward TWSBI. Heck, even my metropolitans aren‚Äôt inked any more, and they‚Äôre great writers as well. I disagree. Of course it‚Äôs an opinion, it couldn‚Äôt be anything else. My described collection and joke regarding my expertise also emphasizes my inexperience with many high quality pens. Describing it as my opinion would have been redundant, in my opinion ?üòâ.

The goal for this post was to pull people in and discuss if they agree, disagree, and what they would propose to be superior. I would say it had done exactly that.

So any way, what would you choose as the greatest pen of all time? Yeah I get it. Good to hear you gave it a shot though from the sound of it! Can‚Äôt say I would be inclined to change my grip for just one pen, regardless of the convenience. Especially so considering how many options are out there, waiting to be added to the collection. Price is definitely still a factor for me. I had to tell my wife the VP was ‚Äò$40 gifted by a family member‚Äô... a half truth at best. (Family gave me $60 ?üòÇ)

If you still got yours, maybe give gripping a bit closer to the nib/slightly below the clip a try! It‚Äôs the sweet-spot for me in terms of writing performance, without particularly hindering comfort. 

The dialog is a fantastic looking pen though. Very stream-lined to me. Absolutely! It really packs a punch. It‚Äôs a shame they haven‚Äôt put out a clipless model yet, as I wonder how many people would join the bandwagon.

Are there better writers out there? No doubt, of course. But for now this thing holds a special place in my heart. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre going to love it! And absolutely. I have to make sure I always know where it is in on my person, which just becomes second nature at a certain point. 

Be sure they don‚Äôt leave it at a nurses station or anywhere besides their body or bags! As sad as it is, even doctors steal. And don‚Äôt get me started on the psych wing! Great pens, and glad to hear you gave the A1 a shot. I‚Äôd like to down the line, though I may wait to see if some of these production issues get resolved first. If they do, pilot may be in for a run for their money! Check Majohn A1 out. There is a clipless model. And it‚Äôs 100% interchangeable with Pilot capless pens. For some reason I didn‚Äôt particularly consider the fermo before purchasing my VP. 

It‚Äôs a great looking pen and I have to take your word for the mechanism. I don‚Äôt think I would be inclined to much more weight, but who knows. 

As silly as it sounds the fermo looks a bit too professional (?) for my taste at the moment. I can‚Äôt quite say what it is, but I respect it I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. My assumption is that it‚Äôs an issue with how it fits your hand/grip and not so much mechanical (since I‚Äôm assuming you changed the entire nib section, and not just the nib itself)

I‚Äôve been wrong before and I will again- but maybe give it a shot with gripping it closer to the nib than you‚Äôre naturally inclined to! I imagine it won‚Äôt be the difference maker, but hey, if this can make a currently worthless pen usable, it‚Äôs worth a shot. You should send it in for repair.  Something's wrong with it.  They'll fix it. Thinking out loud, as you may not recall which ink you were using. The few times I‚Äôve had anything like that happen with a VP is when the ink just wasn‚Äôt the right match. I‚Äôve been using some noticeably dry inks lately, and they don‚Äôt bother me, because I love them that much. But a couple of them, even when used with a wetting agent, just were not going to work in a VP or Decimo with a F or EF nib unit. At no point have these nibs ever been scratchy for me, but the F/EF nib units are extremely fine, and the ink choice matters. For that matter, even when I purchased a few M nib units that were vastly ultrasmooth in terms of writing experience, the Tag Keshimurasaki ink just wasn‚Äôt going to work in that pen, so I moved on and inked it with Iroshizuku Ajisai, and the results were perfect. Now this makes the third mention of the myu, so it must be worth its weight. This pen looks absolutely fantastic. I‚Äôd have to give it a good try if the opportunity arises... You‚Äôve got to give refilling cartridges a chance, and maybe that would change your mind.

With that said- what‚Äôs your most favorite? I‚Äôve got to know now! It‚Äôs like a pod of dolphins in here! Hahaha Can‚Äôt wait for the day I can say I have a montblanc in my pocket. But yeah that convenience is huge. I went fine for this exact reason you listed- I can have all the high grade paper I want at home, but when at work... you best bet they got the cheapest stuff they could! Wow! That is essentially the whole line as I know it! Excluding capless of course, but hardly needs to be included considering the minute differences. The LS is very interesting, though for now I think it places last on my list of potential future purchases in the ‚Äòcapless‚Äô category- the fermo is at the top! I was shocked with how satisfying the click is, particularly when retracting the nib. It really punches back! 

Also, I am eager to get some more experience with gold nibs in the future, especially ones with a degree of flex. I think I‚Äôll have to allow it. 

Personally I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the glossy bodies, otherwise I would have gone for it!

If I had the chance to see one in person as opposed to window shopping online, I very well could have a different opinion. Very similar story to what sparked my initial interest in them!
I‚Äôve got to give the decimo a try one day. For now, the gloss is a bit too flashy for my use cases.

Small hand gang has to stick together! Haha You are 100% correct, they are interchangeable!
Happy to hear you like the pen though, bad luck with the grip. 
The Dialog is a great pen as well! I went fine because all my daily users are EF, and I like to be able to sketch with it a bit. Also, I typically write on normal, low quality copier paper at work. I was concerned the increased flow would be an inconvenience there.
I‚Äôll certainly get a medium as well in the future.

I‚Äôd suggest starting with the medium if you‚Äôre intentions are purely for writing and you most frequently use high quality paper.

If you‚Äôre in a low paper quality work environment, and you want to be sure you can use this pen comfortably there, I‚Äôd go with the fine.

The above is a link to a writing sample by Goulet pens which demonstrates the difference between each nib size! 

Good luck That is exactly my use case for the VP, as well as just regular writing at home as it‚Äôs definitely my best pen overall. 

Great lineup though! I‚Äôve heard solid things about the lamy 2000 performance, but based on my experience with the safari I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever go for it without getting a chance to try it before purchasing. Agree and disagree. I think if you bought the top 20 most highly praised pens, across a massive survey, you‚Äôd be able to make a pretty decent guess. 

But yes, I was in fact joking about my ‚Äòexpertise‚Äô

Edit: what‚Äôs your favorite of your bunch? +1. This comment is at -1 right now. I hate when people downvote a comment made in good faith. At least, comment with your counter argument. I agree. The matte black is the best looking in my option but still what I would politely call an ‚Äúacquired taste‚Äù. That said, the bounce of the nib is amazing. Well, can‚Äôt argue with that!
What is your favorite? Fair enough. I‚Äôm still in the honeymoon stage with it so for now it remains my go to even at home. I‚Äôm curious to see if this will last- I do love the feel of my diamond 580 and the narwhal even. 

The metropolitans I got very early on, so the adjustment in weight and barrel wasn‚Äôt much for me to notice nowadays. 

For the moment it is the most bang for the buck I‚Äôve got, but if I can remember this post in a few years, perhaps I‚Äôll update you with my new preferences! After all, there is still a whole gold nibbed world for me to explore one day... Totally fair! What would you choose? I was wondering if I should expect some wear from the click mechanism itself. 

For me, the clip is totally fine and nonintrusive- but it is an absolute killer for a lot of others. Totally understand. Love it! Hahaha Absolutely. I left my comment in the initial post but proceeded to sing it‚Äôs praises in the comments. It is a surprisingly good pen, and a fantastic starter pen (barring bad luck).

Glad it got you to join the hunt! [deleted] The air seal has served me well so far, but totally fair ciriticism that the main appeal is the click. 

One day I‚Äôll have the parkers and pelikans, heck even pilots that will prove this post wrong... but for now it‚Äôs great! 

It‚Äôs all perspective. Would love to hear what you would choose as the best pen out there. People really love their safaris. A very passionate bunch. 

To me it was almost dead on arrival. The nib on it reminded me of my platinum preppy, and I got a matte black one which was a mistake. The white I gifted to a family member was much nicer looking. But yeah- all in all, I did not like the nib or enjoy writing with it in the slightest. To each their own!

For the VP, a huge part is the convenience. I‚Äôve also had a great time getting into tinkering with cartridge refills and storage etc, as all my other pens have a decent capacity with either piston fills or converters. Also, the writing is far smoother than my other pens, besides maybe my diamond 580. The body shape and look of the matte black has also really appealed to me, which is interesting since all of my favorite pens are demonstrators. I‚Äôve got to get my hands on a fermo I‚Äôm the future to feel it out. I didn‚Äôt consider it to be honest! The twist got overwhelmed by my pull to the click. 

If only I had other buddies who were into ‚Äòwasting‚Äô their money away on fountain pens... haha! The G2 is an absolute classic from my school days. My favorite.

And yes you‚Äôre absolutely right about the small sample size ?üòÇ. With any luck I can add a pelikan, Parker, moonman, montblanc... etc, in time. 

Mainly I‚Äôm just excited this VP is a tier (or several) above my other pens, though I do love my 580. 

I‚Äôve heard mixed opinions on the VP vs the Lamy 2000, though people love to compare them. Two very strong camps there. 

Thanks for the reply! For the price it‚Äôs hard to beat. Plus the looks are great. It doesn‚Äôt write as good as the metro I agree. Interesting‚Ä¶ I may have to research further! This is true so far as I know- though from what I‚Äôve heard the majohn dries out after a couple days. So unfortunately even swapping the bodies for the clipless Majohn would cause trouble. 

Happy to be proven wrong though Former Statement has been corrected Put a Pilot Custom 912 FA on your list!  Awesome pen. Ha, no it doesn‚Äôt work that way with gold nibs, especially in a Vanishing Point or Decimo. You might want to look at the Falcon, or a Custom 74 from Japan, which gives you more flexibility about different nibs that aren‚Äôt available on the Custom 74s that are sold in the United States. >I have to say, when I bought the VP with a gold nib, I expected something much more flexible and soft.

As you found out Gold does not automatically mean soft/flex so don't even try to press them they're not made that way. 99% of the nibs out there be it gold or steel is going to be firm and not intended for any pressure. (even the semiflex/flex that you are more likely to come across from say 1920s pens of certain brands/models \[some are very firm, some are soft, same kind of mix\] aren't going to have that crazy start-end range that people expect when they hear 'flex', just easier to do). 

It's also a myth that gold is smoother, the tipping material used on both gold and steel nibs are a super hard metal alloy, and not steel or gold, the smoothness is also dependent on the shaping and texture of that tip not the base metal of the rest of the nib. Course if you don't have a tipping on a gold nib, it'll smooth out really quick, but you'll wear it down to a stub in a matter of months (hence why nibs are tipped, as even steel will be smooth and wear down in a few years of regular usage if not tipped).   


Fact is, steel nibs can be just as smooth and wet, but most manufactures out of the factory tend to put more attention/finishing on their higher end offerings when they can give the same polishing/shaping treatment to their other nib materials, likewise a nibmeister can perform that same service for about $20 on any material of nib as the tipping is basically the same. Even Pilot can put out a bad nib once in a while. Although it's rumoured that if it happens several times in the same year than the entire production line has to commit sepuku.

..But a lot of Westerners today simply can't use a fine or extra fine Japanese nib. Or sometimes not even a medium. They use too much pressure and blame the pen. Japanese kids grow up writing with O.3mm pencils - those leads have about a third of the strength of what westerners think is a fine pencil lead. The Jowo nibs on twsbis are designed for people used to ballpoints. Most Japanese nibs, definitely not. Looooooooove scratchy/toothy!!!!! Totally fair. I have one TWSBI Eco that‚Äôs relatively smooth, another that is absurdly scratchy with strokes from right to left, which I like least. Otherwise I love the pens- probably mostly for the demonstrator aesthetic. 
Fun to fill the white with red ink and have it look like a syringe in the hospital. The black has bay state blue, so it‚Äôs like a bruise in my mind...

In reality both inks are too dark so you can barely tell, but hey- at least I know. >Meanwhile I've had nothing but negative experiences with TWSBI - weird how some pens just don't work for some folks

It's called QC. I have the current-day elite/e95s, but straight from Japan, where it‚Äôs still got ‚ÄúElite‚Äù written out instead of the E in the US market, so I sometimes use both names interchangeably. I, too, want a vintage one though! A lot of people like the Majohn A1... I feel that 100%. As a teacher, my VP is one of my most-carried pens so I can take quick notes, stop, and start whenever is needed. OMG, right?  There's no excuse for that to still be a problem after 100 freakin years of manufacturing. I always keep mine in a sleeve when not used, so I don‚Äôt have any issues with the paint. One of my friends does, but he says it adds character :) My pen stopped closing all the way (I noticed that the ink was drying out) so I sent it to Pilot and they fixed it. Haha my collection only has 3 brands so I can‚Äôt talk either [removed] The white pearlescent body is still pretty good looking so I may swap a VP unit into it. I don‚Äôt know. Not feeling like messing around with it right now. 

Click click Thank you! I shall! Could be an issue with the trap door mechanism, which is complex and has multiple modes of failure.  If it doesn‚Äôt close properly, the pen will hard start.

I find the trap door requires more maintenance than i want to give it.  My Capless goes mostly unused.  I just use snap-cap pens which are almost as easy and easier to maintain. It‚Äôs probably one of my favorite pens overall regardless of use case so I‚Äôd definitely recommend trying one if you can. How pilot made a steel nib that good I don‚Äôt know

That being said getting that chance can be kind of a pain it‚Äôs one of those pens where the pricing gets silly pretty fast I really should do that at some point. I don't know why I haven't.

My favorite pen and my best writer in a Noodler's Ahab. It's proven itself to be excellent in a LOT of different ways. It has it's quirks, which always makes me wary of suggesting it to new people, but I haven't had a pen yet that writes better, is more durable, more repairable, more eco-friendly, or more flexible in day to day use. It advertises it's low-price flex nib, but honestly I rarely flex. That just gives me a softer writing experience - which is very wet and super fine. I use it with 54th Massachusetts ink right now, which tends to have a lot of spread in my other p";Absolutely fair. People love their faber castells! And to answer your other comment;;
; but even though it's wet; the fine line handles it great. It's finer than my Pilot VP with a pilot fine nib. yes....fine or extra fine helps with cheap paper.....F/EF lets me use moleskines too with little bleed to the back of the paper.;;;;ns;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;you didn't ask but the best notebook I found for fountain pens has been leuchterm.....about same price as moleskine but far superior quality.;;
;;;;;;;;
; but I use it cap off and mostly at home so pretentious to myself maybe.  the writing experience is superior and distinct.  worth the time and effort to save. The Fermo has to be my favorite of the bunch. Such a neat twist mechanism and it just sucks the nib right back in.  The only other one I want is a Vintage Namiki Faceted. They are so very cool looking; but also $500+ and more than I want to spend on another VP variation. Most gold nibs flex a little bit especially the sailor 21k nibs and they give a degree of line variation but gold nibs are not made for a lot of pressure on them like actual flex nibs tho the best you get is maybe one size up example: Fine to a medium. But they have a lot more springy and smooth feel to them That's awesome. Ordering one now to try it in.;;;;montblanc is criticized as pretetious.....it probably is;;
;;;;;;There's no plan to make a clipless version is there? I need to take a look in ebay and see what options there are on the older models. ;;
; everything else I write with is at least med (non Japanese); nmf; architect; broad. Maybe the thin lines and low forgiveness make me think I'm just writing badly with it. I actually want the EF; but the store I was just looking at only had medium or fine.;Another thing that may affect my decision is the fine nib it has;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Its not often high quality paper for me. Usually Thinner paper. Occasional documents (thick paper).;;
;;;;;;;;
; it might be fun to use a VP for that.;;;;;I like the idea of sketching. I do sketch quite a bit. But I use pigment pens with all the various sizes. Still;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;I want the pen as a daily.;;
;;;;;;;;
; but I also had the nib custom ground by [Nibsmith](https://nibsmith.com/product/nib-work/) into a cursive italic nib that writes wonderfully. I happened to be at the right place at the right time at the opening of a new pen store where he was there doing free nib grinds on any pens $100 or more. Awesome ink capacity but it definitely has a sweet spot you have to hold it in to get the best results. I'd definitely recommend trying it first. Hard to choose. I really love my Pilot Myu. The design of the nib is special and it writes really well. Another one I really like is the Conklin mark Twain. But my daily writer is a Pilot Custom 74 in fine. Agreed Love that description. ?üòÇ;;;;;So now I'm leaning towards fine or EF hahaha skirted the initial question. Now I have to look for a place that has EF in stock... My L2K has been great;;
; especially because I know how polarizing the aesthetic is; but I just love it.;;;;I can‚Äôt put my finger on it;;
;;;;;;;;
; I would not stray from the matte black for some reason. My favourite pen is a Yard o Led Viceroy Grand in the Victorian Finish following by the modern Parker Duofold. I still recommend the pilot vp. I think it‚Äôs great. But my Kaweco Special; Diamond mini and pelican 200 are the pens I reach for first. I carry my VP in my pocket with a notebook for jotting notes so it sees quite a bit of use.;;;;Agreed though;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;When you‚Äôre ready for a gold nib my recommendation is to go vintage. I‚Äôve tried several modern ones and several vintage and the vintage ones are all smoother. My wonderful girlfriend tried a couple modern ones and was unimpressed. She preferred her TWSBI. I recently made a trade for a vintage Skyline. When I told her about it she just shrugged. I let her try it out and now it has a home in her pen case.;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Enjoy your new pen. Click click. [deleted] >Shape of a nib has a lot more to do with flex than material. The idea that gold nibs will/should flex is really a misunderstanding.;;

;;;;;;;;
; is not make sure the trap door fully closes (which is usually the result of not putting in the cartridge/converter in fully). If that's popped open a tiny bit it's going to dry out pretty quickly be it the Pilot or the Majohn. I have a several of them and none of them dry out... even after 3 or 4 weeks of sitting unused.  Maybe they got a bad one.  They're actually almost as good as my VPs.  Don't hesitate to try one. Don‚Äôt have Majohn A1;" but I‚Äôve heard that pen needs a about a week to dry out :) Majohn did not """"take over"""" Moonman"; Moonman changed their english company name to Majohn after some really shitty behavior by Kaweco trying to interfere with their ability to do business in the west.

;;;;;;- it's 912 with an FA nib;;
; but if you want to flex; it just won't be adequate;;;;- it's awesome after you replace the feed with an aftermarket one (designed for the FA) as the stock feed is not well suited for western style writing. It would be ok for something like Spencerian;;
;;;;;;;;
; both traditional dip pens and quills; fountain pens with dip nibs; historic flex and semi flex pens; and modern soft nibs; flex nibs;I do have a relatively good selection of flex pens; but still outclassed by my VP. ;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;And I absolutely should have given more attention to the design of the pen itself- you can tell from the photos alone that the nib is not likely to exhibit much flex.;;
;;;;;;;;
; seeing as it‚Äôs so inexpensive as an entry point to that category. ..Then there are the needletip liquid ink pens designed for the Japanese market. I like the uni eye **ultra** micro; but it isn't even officially available in the UK. Some of these pens have a 0.28 ball; meaning they write a 0.14 line. By comparison; 0.7 and 0.9 balls are fine and medium for western office pens. > ..But a lot of Westerners today simply can't use a fine or extra fine Japanese nib. Or sometimes not even a medium.

;;;;;;;;

At this point I feel I‚Äôm too far gone... I imagine you can only go comfortably from A1 to VP and not the opposite. Absolutely- that convenience is just something you can‚Äôt get out of many fountain pens! Hah! Fair. If only they could cram the con70 in there without making it a gargantuan of a pen.

; I was in a hurry and typed it wrong.  I know it's a 912; I've got 2 of them and the stock feeds are fine on both of them.  I've found most people change the feed right out of the gate without even using it with the stock feed. Noodler's and likewise FPR will give a great start-to-end line variation; but compared to most actual flex nibs they require an extreme amount of pressure to get those line variations.;;;Blessings! Sorry;;
;;;;;;;;
; something to keep in mind because the extra pressure can get tiring after a while; also the same degree of pressure would destroy most nibs intended for flex.;;;;Using the fpr ultraflex where they modified it does require less pressure to accomplish the same variation;;
;;;;;;;;

; but at a certain point I need some line thickness! Hahaha Any tips for resolving it? I‚Äôve thought of trying to manipulate the nib myself; but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been bold enough to make a move. I use them both.  It's fine.  The nib on the A1 is steel so it's stiffer.  Other than that; it's pretty much the same.  Get one to carry at work.  You'll be able to carry an extra color like red or something.  Plus; it's nice to have a back-up.  You'll find they don't hold much ink. Definitely!;;I have pretty small handwriting;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Maybe I should go through some of the quirks though.;;
;;;;;;;;
; which out of the box is not great. A deep clean with hot soapy water helps; and the rest goes away with time and use (apparently it has to do with the machining oils used in production; and light will break it down over time).;;;The first is the smell;;
;;;;;;;;
; a very basic but wide clip; etc. The clear ahab absolutely will scratch and scuff with use. ;;;;The second is that it's not really a vanity pen. The nib is extremely utilitarian in design - just a stamp of noodler's ink and a long slit. No gold trim;;
;;;;;;;;
; but you gotta be intentional. It does post nicely enough though.;;;;;The third is that if you like how fast the VP can come out... this thing has some serious fricken threads on it. I don't remember the count of how many turns it takes to take the cap off;;
;;;;;;;;
; but the more you tinker the more you get both the benefits and drawbacks of tinkering. You don't need to tinker (other than a good deep clean at first use). And both of mine wrote just fine without any tweaking. Luckily; it and it's pretty cheap (As far as fountain pens go); so if you go through and screw something up somehow; it's mostly fixable cheaply as well. Noodlers sells a cheap flex nib for less than 20$; but I personally use Conklin flex nibs they‚Äôre qa isn‚Äôt the best but if you get a good pen it‚Äôll treat you well plus theyre bulkier and I like my bulky pens I didn't know the swap was a thing!

;;;;;;;;
; the Procyon feels closest to vintage - something like that Esterbrook; perhaps. And obviously; a fine; only moderately wet nib will write a long way - maybe 600 or 700m. I‚Äôll definitely give it a go. Thanks! All in all it sounds pretty appealing! I‚Äôve already tossed it in my kid for future purchases. ;;Vintage pens were drier too. Of the modern pens I've used;;
;;;;;;The smell is a funny quirk though the threading issue doesn‚Äôt concern me much. Sounds like a great purchase for a desk pen at home.;;
;;;;;;;;
; but one nib is on the poorer side. ;;;;;Thanks for the suggestion! Thank you! I‚Äôll keep it on my list. Totally valid. I‚Äôve loved my ecos;;
;;;;;;I did manage to get a replacement once for I think $5 (shipping cost from the factory). ;;

; several years ago; I bought an antique desk with somebody's collection of Duofolds included.  I wasn't into fountain pens then so I sold them all on ebay.  I'm still kicking myself!  I can't believe I did that.  I so wish I had kept them. Be forewarned; vast majority of vintage nibs do not flex. It's course easier to find in some 1920s and earlier when it was more common; but chances are ones you find in the wild are going to be pretty firm. ;;That A1 may be purchased in the near future... Amen‚Ä¶ Interesting!  Believe it or not  I bought an antique desk with somebody's collection of Duofolds included.  I wasn't into fountain pens then so I sold them all on ebay.  I'm still kicking myself!  I can't believe I did that.  I so wish I had kept them. Be forewarned;;
;;;;;;;;
; but some did also have manifold (super firm) nibs. ;;;;;So ideally if you're hunting vintage for the purpose of flex you have to know which brand/model combination to look for that typically had it. Those also tend to carry a higher price tag due to today's demand for it. A waterman 52 for example is known to have flex;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;My oversized Sheaffer Balance from the 1930s has a nice flexible fine nib on it  but being a US made Balance it's not common for it to have flex (the Canadian made models on the other hand it was more common);;
;;;;;;;;
; as were the 1950s Parker Slimfold and Duofold; but only the UK made ones.;;;;Likewise the 1950s Pelikan 140 were commonly sold with semiflex nibs as were the 1950s Parker Slimfold and Duofold  but only the UK made ones.;;
;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;Not a lot of my vintages have semiflex/flex so it's not the only reason I like vintage. Makes sense. The best man at my wedding moved from China to the US when we were in middle school. We ended up roommates in college and long story short he still wrote in mandarin (?...I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right phrasing) around his drawings. ;;

; it's complicated. The Chinese script is readable by just about all literate Chinese; regardless of the spoken dialect.

Mandarin was the """"trade"""" language"; and also the language of the Imperial Court (meaning bureaucrats spoke it and official functions were carried out in Mandarin).;;I‚Äôll have to consult here somewhere before making a purchase.

Great as a recommendation for those who enjoyed the VP but hate the clip! ;So is it the script that remains the same;;

The capless also comes with a different nib material at a significantly lower cost- a bit less bouncy is what I‚Äôve heard; but I imagine it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd have to feel and see if I can truly tell the difference. Hahaha;;;;;;;

Crazy how Pilot EF nibs can write so thin with minimal feedback. Pilot Vanishing Point EF nib;;"Wow. that is very smol, indeed.

What ink are you using to help you write so tiny? I adore this pen. I‚Äôve found that so much of how it writes is dependant on the ink. Sometimes it overflows, sometimes it‚Äôs dry and horribly scratchy. 

I‚Äôve been going through my inks to find its optimal partner. My Pilot VP EF nib writes smaller than my Platinum 3776 UEF nib. Yes!  Sometimes I use my VP EF just to practice writing as tiny as possible while still being legible.  I‚Äôm just amazed the nib doesn‚Äôt dig into the paper. pad used is a Kokuyo Campus sheet with 5mm grid Agreed. Pilot is the master of the EF.

My favorite EFs are vintage Eversharps (really smooth) and anything Pilot, currently a Custom Grandee Maple. Very fun / thin pen. 

There are SO many pilot options, do you have any others? Now try a Pilot Custom 912 with a ""Posting"" (or PO) nib!

If you‚Äôve ever wondered what the trap door of a Vanishing Point looks like...;;"No, never. But thanks for the insight. It looks very well engineered. It has now sparked the thought of the evolution of all of it previous incarnations as a VP/capless Oddly enough, I was wondering this today.. Am I the only one that thinks... that it looks super cool like this?? Maybe I should run mine like this... well maybe that‚Äôs a bad idea.

How did you remove the clip/section? It's even more impressive once you see how it works Mine isn't working right anymore... Is the nib/feed what's pushing the trap door open or is there another mechanism that opens the trap door? I've wondered on a number of occasions, so I'm very glad you made this! :) I probably stared in a trance at the trap door, clicking it for about 20 minutes, before I realized other people may want to see this. A local customer bought this VP from us recently and the clip just randomly... *fell off.* I don't suspect foul play, rather that this an odd anomaly for Pilot. First time I've ever sent anything in to Pilot USA for repair, I'm hoping to have it back soon to get to my friend/customer who is already missing their VP (and this was their first fountain pen, too)!

And for those wondering (like me), the trap door is very light and I really don't think the nib pushes very hard on it. It surely doesn't seem to affect the nib, especially when you consider the design and the nib itself - it isn't striking the writing surface of the nib. 

I do have an old demo VP that can't be repurposed (it has a permanent banker's leash attached to the plunger clicker). I thought it'd be cool to cut in half (laser, if you will) to see the inner-workings. Wow this is surprisingly erotic Slower you slut That's the coolest thing I've seen all day!   
Thanks for sharing. Reminds me Alien where the mouth comes out of the mouth. I didn't really need another pen, but I just bought one. How long are these designed to last? The thought of having this mechanism get blocked or stop working can give me a nightmare considering it's the precious nib that makes it way through it. the *click* sound is really satisfying Anybody turned on? How I felt when I first saw it I didn't even know that's how they worked. Nope. Never! ?üò± That looks so cool. If I had the money for a vanishing point I would be tempted to keep the ""cap"" off just to see that every time I wrote with it. I might actually enjoy writing with one, if it came like that. I find it really uncomfortable and awkward to hold one because of the clip. Personal preference, but I like the look like this much more and would buy. That looks significantly more effective for sealing than it seems while watching it from outside the clip housing, cool video. Mine has never had an issue with the clip coming off, but I imagine any tolerance or bends whatsoever would develop and get continually worse. I don't think the metal making up the support for the section is particularly springy beyond the usual slight bend of the clip. Does anyone know if there's a way to clean it out except just dipping it in water repeatedly? Mine has picked up dust mixed with ink that's gunking up from being in my jacket pocket everyday. Do you use it like that or what was the reason for taking the ""cap"" off? Just curious. It's super cool really. A local customer bought this from me (their first FP to boot) and the clip just randomly *came off*. It's never happened to any of my VPs or any of the road-worn pen show demo VPs we have in rotation. It's an anomaly for Pilot - we never have had to send a pen in to Pilot USA for anything, so this is a first. My black matte just wiggled off all the time. My yellow hasn't come loose. [deleted] I hear this a lot and worry about mine. Same here. Mine doesn't seat right and leaks ink out, I've tried pulling the clip off and adjusting it but to no avail. Pretty sure it‚Äôs the nib/feed. I've got one I tried to clean out with a cotton swab (I know now not to do that).  The rubber seal is fubar'd, so I may try taking the clip off to see if I might be able to fix it.  Do you have any idea what Pilot charges to fix something like that? I had this happen to me actually. I followed [Binder's words of wisdom](http://www.richardspens.com/ref/repair/vp_clip.htm) on reclamping my old VP cone back down. Going off nothing but anecdotal evidence: a really long time, apparently.

  I haven't seen many people commenting about this mechanism ever failing, and have also seen a few ""vintage"" battle-scarred VPs that still retract/extend confidently.     I personally have run the same VP through a lot of torture (think literally careless handling) and hundreds of converter fills, and it still performs as well as a new one. It almost warrants keeping it for the sake of having something unique! Well, not terribly usable though! This is the first I've seen with the same issue as one of mine. I've not pulled the whole cap off but it has been rotating enough to be annoying. Now I think about it I might glue mine. Looks like the trap door is dislodged. Yea, I don't really get why everyone is saying it looks so well engineered. To me, it looks like it's literally just a coiled wire ‚Äîlike a [clothespin](https://previews.123rf.com/images/montego/montego1412/montego141200111/34165617-wooden-clothespin-3d-illustration-isolated-on-white-background.jpg)‚Äî holding a door shut that gets pushed open by the feed/nib. And that last part I'm really not a fan of. 

I would be interested in knowing how the click mechanism works at the top though, I wonder how much it differs from a regular rollerball click pen. I'm sure it's a custom engineered solution of some sorts. Is there any chance it might damage the nib? You‚Äôre right, the system is rather simple and rudimentary as a whole, but look into it deeper and you can come to appreciate it a bit more. Not to mention, someone had to pioneer it; it‚Äôs always easier in retrospect.

As you said, the trap door is pushed open by the nib and feed. Let‚Äôs just take this one element, a rather crucial one, as example. The angle of the nib/feed design and that of the trap door to allow a smooth action *without damaging the feed nor requiring too much or too little force to click*. The way the trap door never really snaps back on the nib. The way the trap door induces a bit of a leak inside the pen but does not leak out. The way the hinge and clothespin style spring never gets misaligned (the way all clothespin seem to break). The spring coefficient of the spring so that it doesn‚Äôt seem to get loose seemingly ever. The overall durability and predictability of this mechanism.

All of this requires finding the right range of compromise and balance of geometry, forces, materials properties and structural rigidity. That‚Äôs what engineering is about. That‚Äôs the element of appreciation.

It‚Äôs like saying why do people say bakery X‚Äôs bread is so good, it‚Äôs just flour, yeast and water. But without the right combination, technique in manufacturing, and *effort*, you won‚Äôt come to the same result. Not to say it‚Äôs the only way to achieve the same goal though. Why do you think there are so few manufacturers that make retractable fountain pens! [Here](https://estilofilos.blogspot.com/2012/09/cut-away.html) is a post by Bruno Taut that has section photos of most of the models.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv5Qa2kGL04) is a video of how a generic clicky pen operates. Capless is not quite the same but follows the same principle. Pen has been around for decades, and I haven't heard any reports of nibs damaged by the door. Also, the tipping itself is pretty hard, and only in contact with the door for a brief moment. I get what you're saying, but after having seen the body's internals from [this image](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rKn7ARI4eAA/UFALruAGowI/AAAAAAAAD2s/2uoVeFMf83Y/s1600/IMG_0383-1971-blog-WM.jpg) linked by another user, the middle/back of the pen seems like a much more impressive feat of engineering imo.

And has anyone actually done stress tests to see if repeated clicking can damage the nib? Wow, thanks for the links, that's great! True, but if someone goes through the trouble of having a nib tuned, why risk putting (even minute) scratches on it? Sure, most people would notice the difference, but still. Could be improved. As another user has said, the pen has been around for quite a long time, and there have been no issues relating to nib damage from the trapdoor. So, if you take decades of continuous use as a reliable test, yes, many people have tested it. It passed. Oh absolutely, whoever invented the click retractable pen is amazing!

That particular iteration looks practically the same as a standard clickable ball point pen, but these cutouts don‚Äôt allow us to visualize how the interior of the barrel at the clicker end is. If the barrel was all smooth inside, the mechanism would be even more interesting! Cause injection molding guides on a plastic barrel is easy to make, but carving them out in a small brass tube... 

I‚Äôm personally more curious for the C-200SW model though, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because it uses black plastic and so the mechanism is obscured, or it doesn‚Äôt use the same angled tooth/gear system... Just because it isn't broken doesn't mean it can't be improved though. There's no issue, though. What improvement is there to be made? Any change to the closing mechanism just seems like an overcomplication, and wouldn't give any functional improvement. The nib doesn't get damaged at all, it works pretty much perfectly for protecting the nib from drying out, and it's delightfully simple. That's all that's desired. It fulfills its function without any drawback. Is it a marvel of engineering? No, it's clever, but not too impressive. But it doesn't have issues in need of fixing either. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" isn't a common saying for no reason. > without any drawback

But there is one. You'd think that in a hobby where people use 10000 grit sanding utensils people would care about the micro scratches the metal makes to the nib (unless the cover is plastic, then nevermind)

I have to say, I very much disagree with using ""if it aint broke, don't fix it"" for *every. single. thing.* If everyone had this mindset, technology would improve waay slower. For instance: mechanical pencils work fine. But they *were* improved (automatic feeding, spinning lead etc) 10k grit sanding is only to make larger adjustments to the nib, such as the nib thickness. And the part of the nib that pushes the trapdoor is the tip, which is *much* harder than the metal of the trapdoor itself. Plus, it only does the initial push, the rest is done by the (non-functional part of the) feed. It doesn't get scratched.

And you misunderstand the saying then. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" applies if there is no issue, i.e. ""if it ain't broke."" It doesn't mean ""if it ain't completely unusable."" In your example, spinning lead fixes the issue of uneven lead wear, which resulted in the lines drawn being thicker after just a few minutes. Automatic feeding fixes the issue of requiring manual feeding.

These improvements fix issues. What you're complaining with about doesn't cause any issue whatsoever, it's caused no discomfort, no complaint. Pilot Capless has been around in its current form for about 50 years, with very few, only minor changes. If nib scratching were an issue with the design (which the material alone makes *incredibly* unlikely), it would've popped up by now.";1211;https://v.redd.it/uquz49s49x041;fountainpens;"If you‚Äôve ever wondered what the trap door of a Vanishing Point looks like...  No, never. But thanks for the insight. It looks very well engineered. It has now sparked the thought of the evolution of all of it previous incarnations as a VP/capless Oddly enough, I was wondering this today.. Am I the only one that thinks... that it looks super cool like this?? Maybe I should run mine like this... well maybe that‚Äôs a bad idea.

How did you remove the clip/section? It's even more impressive once you see how it works Mine isn't working right anymore... Is the nib/feed what's pushing the trap door open or is there another mechanism that opens the trap door? I've wondered on a number of occasions, so I'm very glad you made this! :) I probably stared in a trance at the trap door, clicking it for about 20 minutes, before I realized other people may want to see this. A local customer bought this VP from us recently and the clip just randomly... *fell off.* I don't suspect foul play, rather that this an odd anomaly for Pilot. First time I've ever sent anything in to Pilot USA for repair, I'm hoping to have it back soon to get to my friend/customer who is already missing their VP (and this was their first fountain pen, too)!

And for those wondering (like me), the trap door is very light and I really don't think the nib pushes very hard on it. It surely doesn't seem to affect the nib, especially when you consider the design and the nib itself - it isn't striking the writing surface of the nib. 

I do have an old demo VP that can't be repurposed (it has a permanent banker's leash attached to the plunger clicker). I thought it'd be cool to cut in half (laser, if you will) to see the inner-workings. Wow this is surprisingly erotic Slower you slut That's the coolest thing I've seen all day!   
Thanks for sharing. Reminds me Alien where the mouth comes out of the mouth. I didn't really need another pen, but I just bought one. How long are these designed to last? The thought of having this mechanism get blocked or stop working can give me a nightmare considering it's the precious nib that makes it way through it. the *click* sound is really satisfying Anybody turned on? How I felt when I first saw it I didn't even know that's how they worked. Nope. Never! ?üò± That looks so cool. If I had the money for a vanishing point I would be tempted to keep the ""cap"" off just to see that every time I wrote with it. I might actually enjoy writing with one, if it came like that. I find it really uncomfortable and awkward to hold one because of the clip. Personal preference, but I like the look like this much more and would buy. That looks significantly more effective for sealing than it seems while watching it from outside the clip housing, cool video. Mine has never had an issue with the clip coming off, but I imagine any tolerance or bends whatsoever would develop and get continually worse. I don't think the metal making up the support for the section is particularly springy beyond the usual slight bend of the clip. Does anyone know if there's a way to clean it out except just dipping it in water repeatedly? Mine has picked up dust mixed with ink that's gunking up from being in my jacket pocket everyday. Do you use it like that or what was the reason for taking the ""cap"" off? Just curious. It's super cool really. A local customer bought this from me (their first FP to boot) and the clip just randomly *came off*. It's never happened to any of my VPs or any of the road-worn pen show demo VPs we have in rotation. It's an anomaly for Pilot - we never have had to send a pen in to Pilot USA for anything, so this is a first. My black matte just wiggled off all the time. My yellow hasn't come loose. [deleted] I hear this a lot and worry about mine. Same here. Mine doesn't seat right and leaks ink out, I've tried pulling the clip off and adjusting it but to no avail. Pretty sure it‚Äôs the nib/feed. I've got one I tried to clean out with a cotton swab (I know now not to do that).  The rubber seal is fubar'd, so I may try taking the clip off to see if I might be able to fix it.  Do you have any idea what Pilot charges to fix something like that? I had this happen to me actually. I followed [Binder's words of wisdom](http://www.richardspens.com/ref/repair/vp_clip.htm) on reclamping my old VP cone back down. Going off nothing but anecdotal evidence: a really long time, apparently.

  I haven't seen many people commenting about this mechanism ever failing, and have also seen a few ""vintage"" battle-scarred VPs that still retract/extend confidently.     I personally have run the same VP through a lot of torture (think literally careless handling) and hundreds of converter fills, and it still performs as well as a new one. It almost warrants keeping it for the sake of having something unique! Well, not terribly usable though! This is the first I've seen with the same issue as one of mine. I've not pulled the whole cap off but it has been rotating enough to be annoying. Now I think about it I might glue mine. Looks like the trap door is dislodged. Yea, I don't really get why everyone is saying it looks so well engineered. To me, it looks like it's literally just a coiled wire ‚Äîlike a [clothespin](https://previews.123rf.com/images/montego/montego1412/montego141200111/34165617-wooden-clothespin-3d-illustration-isolated-on-white-background.jpg)‚Äî holding a door shut that gets pushed open by the feed/nib. And that last part I'm really not a fan of. 

I would be interested in knowing how the click mechanism works at the top though, I wonder how much it differs from a regular rollerball click pen. I'm sure it's a custom engineered solution of some sorts. Is there any chance it might damage the nib? You‚Äôre right, the system is rather simple and rudimentary as a whole, but look into it deeper and you can come to appreciate it a bit more. Not to mention, someone had to pioneer it; it‚Äôs always easier in retrospect.

As you said, the trap door is pushed open by the nib and feed. Let‚Äôs just take this one element, a rather crucial one, as example. The angle of the nib/feed design and that of the trap door to allow a smooth action *without damaging the feed nor requiring too much or too little force to click*. The way the trap door never really snaps back on the nib. The way the trap door induces a bit of a leak inside the pen but does not leak out. The way the hinge and clothespin style spring never gets misaligned (the way all clothespin seem to break). The spring coefficient of the spring so that it doesn‚Äôt seem to get loose seemingly ever. The overall durability and predictability of this mechanism.

All of this requires finding the right range of compromise and balance of geometry, forces, materials properties and structural rigidity. That‚Äôs what engineering is about. That‚Äôs the element of appreciation.

It‚Äôs like saying why do people say bakery X‚Äôs bread is so good, it‚Äôs just flour, yeast and water. But without the right combination, technique in manufacturing, and *effort*, you won‚Äôt come to the same result. Not to say it‚Äôs the only way to achieve the same goal though. Why do you think there are so few manufacturers that make retractable fountain pens! [Here](https://estilofilos.blogspot.com/2012/09/cut-away.html) is a post by Bruno Taut that has section photos of most of the models.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv5Qa2kGL04) is a video of how a generic clicky pen operates. Capless is not quite the same but follows the same principle. Pen has been around for decades, and I haven't heard any reports of nibs damaged by the door. Also, the tipping itself is pretty hard, and only in contact with the door for a brief moment. I get what you're saying, but after having seen the body's internals from [this image](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rKn7ARI4eAA/UFALruAGowI/AAAAAAAAD2s/2uoVeFMf83Y/s1600/IMG_0383-1971-blog-WM.jpg) linked by another user, the middle/back of the pen seems like a much more impressive feat of engineering imo.

And has anyone actually done stress tests to see if repeated clicking can damage the nib? Wow, thanks for the links, that's great! True, but if someone goes through the trouble of having a nib tuned, why risk putting (even minute) scratches on it? Sure, most people would notice the difference, but still. Could be improved. As another user has said, the pen has been around for quite a long time, and there have been no issues relating to nib damage from the trapdoor. So, if you take decades of continuous use as a reliable test, yes, many people have tested it. It passed. Oh absolutely, whoever invented the click retractable pen is amazing!

That particular iteration looks practically the same as a standard clickable ball point pen, but these cutouts don‚Äôt allow us to visualize how the interior of the barrel at the clicker end is. If the barrel was all smooth inside, the mechanism would be even more interesting! Cause injection molding guides on a plastic barrel is easy to make, but carving them out in a small brass tube... 

I‚Äôm personally more curious for the C-200SW model though, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because it uses black plastic and so the mechanism is obscured, or it doesn‚Äôt use the same angled tooth/gear system... Just because it isn't broken doesn't mean it can't be improved though. There's no issue, though. What improvement is there to be made? Any change to the closing mechanism just seems like an overcomplication, and wouldn't give any functional improvement. The nib doesn't get damaged at all, it works pretty much perfectly for protecting the nib from drying out, and it's delightfully simple. That's all that's desired. It fulfills its function without any drawback. Is it a marvel of engineering? No, it's clever, but not too impressive. But it doesn't have issues in need of fixing either. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" isn't a common saying for no reason. > without any drawback

But there is one. You'd think that in a hobby where people use 10000 grit sanding utensils people would care about the micro scratches the metal makes to the nib (unless the cover is plastic, then nevermind)

I have to say, I very much disagree with using ""if it aint broke, don't fix it"" for *every. single. thing.* If everyone had this mindset, technology would improve waay slower. For instance: mechanical pencils work fine. But they *were* improved (automatic feeding, spinning lead etc) 10k grit sanding is only to make larger adjustments to the nib, such as the nib thickness. And the part of the nib that pushes the trapdoor is the tip, which is *much* harder than the metal of the trapdoor itself. Plus, it only does the initial push, the rest is done by the (non-functional part of the) feed. It doesn't get scratched.

And you misunderstand the saying then. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" applies if there is no issue, i.e. ""if it ain't broke."" It doesn't mean ""if it ain't completely unusable."" In your example, spinning lead fixes the issue of uneven lead wear, which resulted in the lines drawn being thicker after just a few minutes. Automatic feeding fixes the issue of requiring manual feeding.

These improvements fix issues. What you're complaining with about doesn't cause any issue whatsoever, it's caused no discomfort, no complaint. Pilot Capless has been around in its current form for about 50 years, with very few, only minor changes. If nib scratching were an issue with the design (which the material alone makes *incredibly* unlikely), it would've popped up by now.";;
Comparing the Pilot Vanishing Point and Moonman A1 in Matte Black;;"Just got my first Namiki VP (from the 90's). Medium nib and writes like a dream. It makes me realize how much my VP has worn over the years, I have the matte black, but now it looks more like the moon man does. I recently acquired the Pilot Vanishing Point to accompany my Moonman and here's how it goes:

The Body

* The vanishing point is more ""matted"" and the texture is close to a chalkboard. Personally, I like how more muted of a black it is compared to the Moonman
* The VP is 5 grams lighter and the difference is really noticeable. It's more comfortable while writing in class (if the clip doesn't bother you)
* The ""click"" on the Moonman is more pronounced/tactile and I like it better as I like loud clicking pens

The Nib

* Both are <EF>  but the Moonman waaaaay smoother. But, that's because the VP is a true japanese EF while the moonman writes like a western EF
* VP gold nib is bouncer and I was actually surprised when I tried to put a little more pressure in it. Moonman meanwhile is stiff, and reverse writing is useable 
* Filling and sealing mechanism on both performs well

Overall, the Moonman is really a good deal for its price if you're going for broader nibs anyway. I have found the parts to be interchangeable, especially the nib and cartridges/converter. I originally had an EF Vanishing Point. It was way too scratchy and stiff. Made me sad having spent $150. I took a chance and bought the F nib. I have been happy with the pen as my EDC. On my Moonman A1, the end of the barrel that meets the grip section is pretty sharp. Whereas, on the VP, it's rounded. Is this also the case with yours or is it just a factory defect on mine? I put Private Reserve Infinity Black in my A1 and it was rock solid dependable to the last drop of ink. I love my clipless Moonman A1s so much because they have the click mechanism which is hand for office notes and they don't have the Pilot clip that used to get in the way of my fingers. The nib is smooth but I don't like fine nibs so I've replaced them with Pilot gold nibs and now I have the best of both worlds! It‚Äôs interesting to me that you guys (this sub) have a fairly neutral/logical stance on the blatant design copying. 

On /r/femalefashionadvice, for example, copies of designer bags are terribly frowned upon and discussed in the same angry outraged way, copying bad IP theft stealing etc. etc.

But loads of people on that sub still quietly frequent /r/repladies (the fake bag sub for very expensive quality fakes), just that nobody dares post their fake bags on /r/femalefashionadvice because the people who buy original bags would start yelling at them.

Seems to be a ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù case on this sub, pretty interesting! I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about the copying, overall. I got jinhaos. But I can see both sides of the story. I want to thank you so much for this. I love new pens but I'm pretty cheap at the moment and cannot justify the VP's price range. Moonman is more my wallet's style atm. This review has helped sooooo much. My Moonman A1  leaks ink under the door and gets all over the nib body. It‚Äôs a mess. Personally I will not buy another Moonman. I like that matte black. Not too sure how I feel about a clicker fountain pen. Kind of a traditional fountain pen kind of guy. I like the classics. What a coincidence! I have these two coming in the mail as well. Couldnt resist the price with the yen so low. It looks like whichever one came second did the whole ""copy it, but change something to make it look a little different"" thing lol What's the metal on Moonman? brass? And how is the coating applied?

For me at least, the VP's main failing is the low quality coating. It wears off very quickly. I know that some people are into the ""patina"" look, but I'm not. The design theft is pretty egregious, honestly Moon man looks slimmer i might just buy one I love the faceted 90s Vanishing Points. I have both a blue and a stealth black one. Love the elegance of the clip, the way it flows into the tip. Reminds me of a nose cone from a sleek fighter jet from the 60s. They‚Äôre both amazing writers, too. Same. Can you expand on the difference between a western EF tip and a Japanese EF tip please? I just got mine and both are in fine, with the VP costing 275% more. At fine, both of my copies p\`roduce a similar line width, except on the cross stroke for which the VP is a touch thinner. While I deem both smooth, the VP feels more pencil-like and with less audible feedback. The click on the VP has a bit more ""thocc"" but is otherwise very similar to the A1.

I'm wondering if your copy of the A1 is aligned properly. Could be just the optical illusion/parallax of your photo but it appears that you might have the same issue as me which is that the gap that houses the bump of the nib unit to keep it from rotating inside is [misaligned with the rest of the body](https://imgur.com/ALv77WD), resulting in nib crooked to the rest of the pen. I got what I paid for, I suppose. I love using my moonman VP reverse! Tbh Pilot con 40 is garbage so this is good news. My experience exactly! The F is great. I wish the M wasn‚Äôt such a huge increase in line width. it sure has that feedback but tolerable if EF is a must Mine isn‚Äôt sharp, though you can feel it. I think yours might be a defect Not directly addressed in the more extensive subthread, but apropos here is the point that handbags and such have a huge problem with actual *counterfeiting*. When a copy of any exactness or not is passed off AS the original, there's some definite illegality/ impropriety. Logos, company names - those matter. Jinhao doesn't sell their pens AS Lamys or Parkers, for instance, though some shady resellers might. Fashion has a crazy short fuse - I bet most high class fashionistas couldn't care less if a *three year old* [insert disdainful sniff] design was copied - indeed, that's what the idea of a *fashion leader* is - that 'the unwashed herd' *follows*. I think there are a couple elements to this.  First, although we sometimes talk about these pens as knock-offs, really they‚Äôre not marketed and sold as being brands that they aren‚Äôt.  The Moonman pen doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúPilot‚Äù or ‚ÄúPilat‚Äù or anything like that. But second, generally the patents for the IP that is being copied has long expired.  I don‚Äôt know the details of the patent that Pilot has, or had, for the vanishing point, but I believe the basic design has been around since‚Ä¶the 60‚Äôs or 70‚Äôs?

Protecting IP serves an essential role in society, but there are also good reasons that patents and copyrights expire.  Patent law has to strike a balance between the competing interests of the company to recoup their investments costs and make a fair profit for their novel design against the interest of the public in being able to improve existing technology and make it more accessible.

In this case for instance, Moonman also makes a clipless version.  I honestly don‚Äôt know if Pilot does, but the times I‚Äôve googled around for one, I haven‚Äôt been able to find one.  So a person who prefers the vanishing point without a clip might benefit from that design change. Certainly the reduced price of Moonman makes the technology more accessible to a wider group of people. This is built into the copyright and patent system for good reason.  If you have a novel idea/design your are rightfully given an exclusive right to sell that design for a finite amount of time to make the return on your investment and profit from (presumably) contributing to society in some way.

However, your idea did not occur in a vacuum, you are standing on the shoulders of giants, benefiting from previous ideas and the infrastructure of society writ large.  As such, after your exclusivity period is over, your patent becomes public domain, allowing others to build on (or copy) your idea.  Just because you came up with a good idea once doesn‚Äôt mean that your estate or corporation gets to milk it for the rest of human existence.

It is that expiry of exclusivity that allows technology to march on by forcing companies to innovate or die, or at least allow others to build on a good idea or make it more accessible. I think a lot of it has to do with usability versus fashion as well. Pens are designed to be used, so functionality (particularly of the VP) matters more than the style. The functionality is long out of patent.

Personally though, I refuse to buy the knockoffs. If you want to copy the functionality of the VP, I'm fine with that. Use the expired patents. But they copied literally everything. They copied the proprietary pilot cartridge sizing. They copied the style of the clip. The parts are literally swappable with each other. I would like that only if it was due to standardization, but it's not. Moonman literally is adding nothing to the pen except for cheap labor. I find it leaky too when using the converter but when I filled up a cartridge with a more saturated ink, the burped ink is noticeably less Yes, some of the nib units have been found to be leaky, this is a known defect and you aren‚Äôt the only one with this issue. You should request an exchange if you can. ~~A lot~~ All of my MoonMan pens have broken badly. I spent enough money on them I could have bought a higher quality pen, and saved myself the grief. I‚Äôve only found that to happen if I let the nib snap back forcefully when I retract it. Have you tried clicking it more gently or is it actually leaking? The Moonman matte coating feels worse than the Pilot IMO. It‚Äôs almost tacky feeling. They seems to be specific to the matte black version. Any other is high quality. It‚Äôs brass on the Moonman also.

I haven‚Äôt found the VP‚Äôs coating to come off quickly, perhaps it varies by finish? It‚Äôs not IP theft. [we‚Äôve covered this before](https://reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/qvzwwz/_/hkzp01b/?context=1)

Edit: contrary to below poster, I link to my old comment because it provides a succinct summary of the issue. I‚Äôm not expecting everyone to have read it‚Äîthe question of IP law is discussed all the time on this sub, basically every time another clone pen is posted like an A1 or Jinhao 80.

Essentially, please [don‚Äôt call it theft](https://youtu.be/IeTybKL1pM4) if you aren‚Äôt prepared to back up your characterization of copying as a crime. It most likely isn't slimmer.  The A1 is much heftier and just as girthy.  If you want slimmer, look to the decimo. I didn't realize they existed. Might need another one. ?üòâ so the ones form the 90s have the faceted clip?

That is what I am looking for! What does faceted mean? Just stumbled upon the Moonman A2, which also has a faceted body. Single color choices for the barrel, but you can choose between either black or chrome hardware. Western-made nibs such as Lamy, Jowo, Bock have EF nibs that write thicker compared to Japanese-made EF nibs such as Pilot, Platinum, Sailor. 

The actual line widths vary between pens, paper, and inks but Japanese EF nibs write close to 0.38mm tip ballpoint, while Western EF nibs write close to 0.5mm tip ballpoint. Values are just estimates as EF is a tough grind to perfect In lamen terms Japanese nibs are one size smaller than western nibs. So that Japanese F nib is more compared to a Western EF nib. In OP case, that Japanese EF is like an extra extra fine western nib yes, the A1 is not perfectly aligned but not prominent enough to cause any writing issues Seems like you've hit a significant point - trying to emulate/draw from the design of others is broadly more acceptable than a straight up ripoff, logos and all.

I think the relatively small size of this community helps somewhat, the economy of scale just isn't present for obviously infringing knockoff products - it makes more sense to do a similar product that can be sold openly through normal channels.

Not to say that we're immune from such things, just that there are better opportunities for product fraud in other areas - like fashion. Ahhhh, spoken like a man who does not know about the quintessential black Chanel quilted bag. The most coveted pieces are not about the newest and hottest trends and if you refer to Crazy Rich Asians, many truly stylish people wear classic, vintage pieces and don‚Äôt follow the herd. (The herd therefore wants to follow those people.) 

Yes, I agree with you that they are not explicitly counterfeited with brand names on them.

I just can‚Äôt think of a legit, noble reason with regards to them making identical copies of designer pens, though. They didn‚Äôt start the business to nobly fulfill the designer pen dreams of us poor middle class folk who shop at Forever 21 and can only afford Forever 21 pens. 

It does seem to be a bit dodgy to me, but yep sure, I‚Äôll buy if I like it. I think people are more outraged at the general ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù of it, rather than the actual technicalities. 

‚ÄúJust because you can do it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right to do it!‚Äù 

Like, there really isn‚Äôt any good reason (other than to make money) for Jinhao and Moonman to purposefully make a 100% identical copy of those pens. In fast fashion, for example, they at least try to tweak the original designer‚Äôs design to some extent, but to be fair, Forever 21 often copied designer runway pieces in an identical manner and it seemed to be acceptable. 

The Chinese are well-known to be excellent at making knockoffs of everything, and it certainly has extended to pens. I have personally seen genuine Nike shoes taken apart so that they can study and replicate every piece of the shoe (they do that with Herm√®s bags as well), and visited some of the fake goods areas. (I‚Äôm Chinese but not from China.) They are very practical, scrappy business people. They make what people want to buy. ‚ÄúHaha but is it ethical‚Äù is not a priority in China.  

Perhaps their penchant for copying is deservedly perceived in a bad light, since we ‚Äúknow‚Äù that designer fashion knockoffs are bad/unethical/aid criminal activity and money laundering. 

I don‚Äôt have a conclusion really - but I suspect the Chinese take great pride in their ability to produce 100% identical copies of American designs. It‚Äôs like a game for them. 

I might have just bought Taobao copies of very well-known Diamine and Sailor inks. So normally I‚Äôd agree but here‚Äôs another side of the story: some people cannot or won‚Äôt spend $150+ on a pen. I don‚Äôt think Moonman/Majohn is really taking customers away from Pilot by offering A1 at the fifth of the price, they‚Äôre just catering to a different audience. If someone wants something like a VP without the price tag, I don‚Äôt see a problem with that. No one is at a loss.

And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who has the VP but not the A1. Although I‚Äôd personally buy both. There is a small hole under the feed under the nib area, it‚Äôs square in shape. I‚Äôve filled my moonman with some thick silicone grease and mine have never leaked. I found a YouTuber (forget his name) who‚Äôs pen leaked profusely and this was his solution. I think the little trap door actually drags across the top of the nib when retracting and extending. I have had to use a long cotton swab several times to clean the ink out of the barrel. Yeah, I've heard this too. Seems to be something to do with the matte coating application process. Yeah it was a known issue for the matte black versions. I guess they changed formulations and for a while the paint was less resistant. Seams like it has changed innrecent years though there are some aspects of the pen (breather whole, ring, spring mechanism, clip attachment, etc) that are subtly different from the original one. same way how fast fashion change about 7 design aspects from a reference to get away with it [deleted] Fine, let me rephrase it then. Instead of creating a whole new, unique pen that only the Chinese can make, they decide to blatantly reverse engineer an already established product. A product that another company that has been around for over 100 years have put in the blood, sweat, and tears to make. No, it‚Äôs still stealing a design regardless of the law. 

These companies repeatedly copy and steal designs whether or not their country forces them to honor other nations IP protection laws. The body isn‚Äôt round. It has about 18 facets. Catches light beautifully. I kinda wish it was metal since I don't like how cheap plastic pens feel after like 5 bucks /u/moonstonewish, everything said above by /u/dangkaniel is correct, in general, but there are some Japanese pens that tend to be more like western nibs, good examples are the Pilot Varsity or the Platinum Plasir, both tend to have a bolder nib for the size than other pens in the brand.   
    
So, trust but verify when you get a nib.   
    
Another good example, the Moonman A-1 is a 0.4mm nib, but a wet one, so it tends to write bolder than the nib size would indicate.  A good dry ink will help bring it back to writing like an bold EF and as expected for stated size of 0.4mm (it is sold by nib size in China and as an 'EF' when sold to western people). I see. Thank you for the information. I appreciate it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Just as a note, the phrase is ""layman's terms"" when you're referring to simple language that anyone can understand. :) Right! You used that word ""style"" which is like 465,004th on my list of things to care about.  So yeah, I'm not going to analyze that realm right.  You also said ""designer pen""... that's as opposed to what, ""utilitarian pen""?  I bought some super cheap pens at Five Below to practice nib grinding.    The ones that use Lamy cues to I guess ""look respectably fancy"" are OK cheap pens, where the truly anonymous pens that follow no leader are pretty much junk, functionally.   All are unbranded - the package just has the name of a Chinese importer - I doubt the 5 or 6 types even have the same manufacturer.  Example - both the ones that have caps inspired by a Safari or All-Star, the cap measurements are subtly different.

""Forever 21 pens"" - so I was briefly excited to think there might be *another* store in my town with SoMe SoRt of fountain pen - thus far it's Office Depot and Five Below.  Then I realized you're using an analogy.   Oh, well ;-).

I honestly have to scratch my head at the motivations and methods of influencers, and designers.  No doubt one reason there's a growing bald spot.  I get that fancy fashion folk want to be out in front of the herd - but don't they *want* a herd?  If for no other reason than so they can be superior to someone whose little black bag came from the trunk of a '93 LeBaron out on the bypass, under a sign proclaiming Genuine Faux Channel and Coach Koar Bags?

In this subreddit I don't get much of the superiority vibe - I'm sure there are some such folk, but Reddit does not select for ""pretentious"" :-) If real snootiness comes out, so do the snark-knives.  It's fair enough if you drive a Maserati, to look down on the guy with a VW kit-car that's Maserati-shaped... I guess.  Me - I look at the putt-putt version and enjoy the bumper stickers on it, and wonder if I had one could I put a trailer hitch on it.  And I think of the news photo showing some poor guy's exotic car sinking after hurricane Ian, whereas VW Beetles supposedly CAN float...   I'm not in the market for a VP, and  honestly, the A1 is *above* my current pen limit.  I'm using a Pilot Metro as my upper budget bound - I might could find a used A1 on r/pen_swap for under the going rate for a Metro, if I wanted to... [checks] yep; 20 bucks.  Great.  I doubt I could find a VP for that which had not spent weeks in the floaty-Ferrari, then got run over by the VW.

I see some people happy to spend large lucre on really nice pens *because they make them happy*, and ""they write nice"", and most of those seem to be ok with me having a happy place at the couch-cushion pocket-change level.  Wrestling this ramble back around to the point (B-nib, not EF); nah, the clonemasters don't want to make my plebe pen-dreams come true, they just want to make a buck.  The invisible hand of that economic impulse is attached to an invisible elbow in the ribs of complacent elder manufacturers, who thus have a teensy incentive to improve their offerings and earn my buck instead.  NewParker isn't doing that - by most reports Chinese copies of OldParker 51s are often better pens than the NewParker copies of OldParker 51s. Whether or not you're willing to pay the prices is a completely different consideration IMO. I filter away knockoffs on principle first, and THEN consider the cost/benefit ratio. I don't consider the cost of a knockoff in the calculation at all.

If I were looking at pens in the roughly $50 price range, and I had specific requirements for quick draw, then the pens that draw my attention simply have non-threaded caps (snap cap, slip-on, magnetic, etc).

If I **required** a click pen for some artificial reason, and I refused to pay more than $100 ... pilot does sell a steel-nibbed version, and teh platinum curadas also exists. If I had a max limit of $50 (which is, btw, also huge for a pen remember), then there is also the option of... waiting and saving up. Can I ask, do you fill that hole with the silicon grease? Storage probably makes a difference too. And to me, the VP is one of the few pens in my collection that doesn‚Äôt get babied because it‚Äôs a purpose bought work horse. So it doesn‚Äôt matter where I put it down, how I store it or if I drop it. (Nib retracted of course). 

Despite being left in the sun, dropped dozens and dozens of times, spun on tables, left unprotected in a pile of other pens and heavily used for the last 7 years, by blue on rhodium shows little signs of wear. There‚Äôs nothing to get away with. The design of the Capless is long out of design protection, it‚Äôs legal to copy it, exactly down to the millimeter if you want, as long as you don‚Äôt write PILOT on it. [deleted] This characterization of ‚Äúblatant‚Äù and ‚Äúblood, sweat, and tears‚Äù is emotional and not based on fact. Companies like Pilot and Lamy make these designs knowing that the exclusivity will expire in 25 years. It‚Äôs built into their R&D plans. They aren‚Äôt offended when other companies copy an old design, they aren‚Äôt caught out by it, and there is no rational reason for normal fountain pen users to be either. [deleted] Your comment was a work of art and thoroughly enjoyed on my part, but I might take some time to reply although I‚Äôve read it a few times and laughed every single time ?üòÜ Gotta do weekend things with the kid, let me come back and respond!! Fair enough. I just believe there‚Äôs a market for everyone. I‚Äôd have a problem with the pen if it were branded as Pilot and sold as one of course! Yes, no leak in months Of having them, even after dropping one on concrete [deleted] I think some  get mad because they spend so much money on the original while someone els gets the ""same"" product for a craction of the price. Kinda like the guy who drives up to the front of the traffic and cuts in while we are waiting patiently lol That's not the point. Like I said, it still would have at least been more respectable if they just made their own, unique pen. They took the easy way out. Why don't *they* put in the R&D? You know why? Because they know somebody else will I'm truly sorry for offending you. No offense was meant. And if I may, what culture are you referring to? I'd love to learn more about your usage of the term. I hope someone with better memory than me comes in and explains again how knockoffs tend to have a neutral to positive effect on luxury  brands. I have half a brain cell  left but this is definitely something that has been analyzed and studied. Gotcha, thank you!! LOL.  Do you really believe that anyone buying this Majohn at $25 is now going to NOT buy a Pilot VP?

It's lazy for them to steal the design this blatantly, but Pilot isn't losing any business over this any more than Lamy is losing L2K sales because of the JinHao 80.  They might look the same but they aren't the same or we would suddenly be seeing the OEMs pop up all over Pen_Swap and eBay as people rushed to sell their VP for $130 so they can replace it with an A1 and collect a cool $100, too. It doesn‚Äôt have to be commendable, and it might be distasteful. That‚Äôs a question of opinion. My only point is that it is factually not stealing. There is actualy a video on youtube explaining whybthe chinese do this. 

En gros 

Its a socialist / communist phenomena where all must be equal. Therefore creativity is punished. So a way to get the creativity out of their system is to copy and change pre existing ideas that are already socialy acceptable to their liking. Thats why the moon man A1 also has a clipless version. 

Its much more complicated than simply copying. 

In addition, they are not occupying the same space in the market. They are ironicaly democratizing fountain pens because they make it much more accesable to lower income individuals. 

Someone who wants a premium gold nib capless will still buy a pilot even if they buy a moonman first.

Actualy in in the early 2000 companies like adolbe would shadow release software keys to their products like photoshop because they knew that those who pirated their software would learn it and eventualy buy it when they became professional. It was a whole strategy. 

Also to be fair, western cultures copy all the time. In music we often sample from other artists and change it slightly to our liking. And there is nothing anyone can do to about it. Cause evertthing influences everything. 

Thats why the katy perry lawsuit about the chord progression was ridiculus. I disagree with this because cutting in is quite an asshole move because the people behind have to physically wait longer and their day is affected in terms of physical time. 

However, buying an original vs. buying a copy, does not physically affect the original buyer in the same way in terms of causing their day‚Äôs plans to be affected.

Just a thought xD I think it‚Äôs the brainwashing that big media companies have been shoving down our throats for decades that copying is bad and somehow comparable to piracy (in which people actually lose lives, talk about an exaggerated comparison). People don‚Äôt realize‚Äî after being fed this crap for their whole lives‚Äîthat it doesn‚Äôt make sense. Copying doesn‚Äôt take it away from the original owner, and there are legally mandated periods of exclusivity for creators after which copying is allowed, but somehow people make it a moral issue when it isn‚Äôt one. They did make a clipless version which Pilot has not done for whatever reason. Because originality (or for that matter, respectability) is not the only purpose of bringing things to market. Not everyone has 150 USD to spend on a Capless. Moonman is giving people a choice to buy a cheaper and less well-built version if that‚Äôs what they can afford. This is a cycle that happens for all kinds of products. Not every plastic food container is made by Tupperware or Rubbermaid anymore.

In fact, the usual effect of the existence of a cheaper option is that the market for such a product expands, meaning the original product also gets more sales from awareness. Just on this sub you‚Äôll find a lot of people who bought an A1 and liked it so much they bought a Capless. 

You are free to find copying distasteful, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs actually anything wrong with it. It‚Äôs a normal part of product ideas being reused and remixed. I don‚Äôt have great memory and I‚Äôm also lazy but here‚Äôs one example: https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/knockoff-appeal-counterfeits-can-boost-sales-of-the-real-thing/381801/ Source on ‚Äúcreativity is punished‚Äù in socialism & communism? I agree with you. 

I remember those piracy ads that they would show on vhs and dvds back in the day. 

""You wouldnt kill someone , so why why would you pirate"" 

Lol wut? 

Further up in the thread i mentionned how adolbe used to release keys to their products as a buisnees strategy. 

Kids use pirated photoshop-> they learn the software-> they grow up become proffesionals and buy the product 

Actualy to not copy after the copyright would actualy be detremental to innovation and the market would ultimatly stagnate Adjacent if not exact (conformity vs. individualism being related to copy vs. innovate), the proverb variously attributed to Japan and China is that ""the nail that sticks up will be hammered down"". So perhaps in addition to socialism/collectivism there's just an oriental-society mindset in play. Sure, there's innovation going on - but a lean toward conformity could be a decent generalization.";294;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/y9ior7;fountainpens;"Comparing the Pilot Vanishing Point and Moonman A1 in Matte Black  Just got my first Namiki VP (from the 90's). Medium nib and writes like a dream. It makes me realize how much my VP has worn over the years, I have the matte black, but now it looks more like the moon man does. I recently acquired the Pilot Vanishing Point to accompany my Moonman and here's how it goes:

The Body

* The vanishing point is more ""matted"" and the texture is close to a chalkboard. Personally, I like how more muted of a black it is compared to the Moonman
* The VP is 5 grams lighter and the difference is really noticeable. It's more comfortable while writing in class (if the clip doesn't bother you)
* The ""click"" on the Moonman is more pronounced/tactile and I like it better as I like loud clicking pens

The Nib

* Both are <EF>  but the Moonman waaaaay smoother. But, that's because the VP is a true japanese EF while the moonman writes like a western EF
* VP gold nib is bouncer and I was actually surprised when I tried to put a little more pressure in it. Moonman meanwhile is stiff, and reverse writing is useable 
* Filling and sealing mechanism on both performs well

Overall, the Moonman is really a good deal for its price if you're going for broader nibs anyway. I have found the parts to be interchangeable, especially the nib and cartridges/converter. I originally had an EF Vanishing Point. It was way too scratchy and stiff. Made me sad having spent $150. I took a chance and bought the F nib. I have been happy with the pen as my EDC. On my Moonman A1, the end of the barrel that meets the grip section is pretty sharp. Whereas, on the VP, it's rounded. Is this also the case with yours or is it just a factory defect on mine? I put Private Reserve Infinity Black in my A1 and it was rock solid dependable to the last drop of ink. I love my clipless Moonman A1s so much because they have the click mechanism which is hand for office notes and they don't have the Pilot clip that used to get in the way of my fingers. The nib is smooth but I don't like fine nibs so I've replaced them with Pilot gold nibs and now I have the best of both worlds! It‚Äôs interesting to me that you guys (this sub) have a fairly neutral/logical stance on the blatant design copying. 

On /r/femalefashionadvice, for example, copies of designer bags are terribly frowned upon and discussed in the same angry outraged way, copying bad IP theft stealing etc. etc.

But loads of people on that sub still quietly frequent /r/repladies (the fake bag sub for very expensive quality fakes), just that nobody dares post their fake bags on /r/femalefashionadvice because the people who buy original bags would start yelling at them.

Seems to be a ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù case on this sub, pretty interesting! I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about the copying, overall. I got jinhaos. But I can see both sides of the story. I want to thank you so much for this. I love new pens but I'm pretty cheap at the moment and cannot justify the VP's price range. Moonman is more my wallet's style atm. This review has helped sooooo much. My Moonman A1  leaks ink under the door and gets all over the nib body. It‚Äôs a mess. Personally I will not buy another Moonman. I like that matte black. Not too sure how I feel about a clicker fountain pen. Kind of a traditional fountain pen kind of guy. I like the classics. What a coincidence! I have these two coming in the mail as well. Couldnt resist the price with the yen so low. It looks like whichever one came second did the whole ""copy it, but change something to make it look a little different"" thing lol What's the metal on Moonman? brass? And how is the coating applied?

For me at least, the VP's main failing is the low quality coating. It wears off very quickly. I know that some people are into the ""patina"" look, but I'm not. The design theft is pretty egregious, honestly Moon man looks slimmer i might just buy one I love the faceted 90s Vanishing Points. I have both a blue and a stealth black one. Love the elegance of the clip, the way it flows into the tip. Reminds me of a nose cone from a sleek fighter jet from the 60s. They‚Äôre both amazing writers, too. Same. Can you expand on the difference between a western EF tip and a Japanese EF tip please? I just got mine and both are in fine, with the VP costing 275% more. At fine, both of my copies p\`roduce a similar line width, except on the cross stroke for which the VP is a touch thinner. While I deem both smooth, the VP feels more pencil-like and with less audible feedback. The click on the VP has a bit more ""thocc"" but is otherwise very similar to the A1.

I'm wondering if your copy of the A1 is aligned properly. Could be just the optical illusion/parallax of your photo but it appears that you might have the same issue as me which is that the gap that houses the bump of the nib unit to keep it from rotating inside is [misaligned with the rest of the body](https://imgur.com/ALv77WD), resulting in nib crooked to the rest of the pen. I got what I paid for, I suppose. I love using my moonman VP reverse! Tbh Pilot con 40 is garbage so this is good news. My experience exactly! The F is great. I wish the M wasn‚Äôt such a huge increase in line width. it sure has that feedback but tolerable if EF is a must Mine isn‚Äôt sharp, though you can feel it. I think yours might be a defect Not directly addressed in the more extensive subthread, but apropos here is the point that handbags and such have a huge problem with actual *counterfeiting*. When a copy of any exactness or not is passed off AS the original, there's some definite illegality/ impropriety. Logos, company names - those matter. Jinhao doesn't sell their pens AS Lamys or Parkers, for instance, though some shady resellers might. Fashion has a crazy short fuse - I bet most high class fashionistas couldn't care less if a *three year old* [insert disdainful sniff] design was copied - indeed, that's what the idea of a *fashion leader* is - that 'the unwashed herd' *follows*. I think there are a couple elements to this.  First, although we sometimes talk about these pens as knock-offs, really they‚Äôre not marketed and sold as being brands that they aren‚Äôt.  The Moonman pen doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúPilot‚Äù or ‚ÄúPilat‚Äù or anything like that. But second, generally the patents for the IP that is being copied has long expired.  I don‚Äôt know the details of the patent that Pilot has, or had, for the vanishing point, but I believe the basic design has been around since‚Ä¶the 60‚Äôs or 70‚Äôs?

Protecting IP serves an essential role in society, but there are also good reasons that patents and copyrights expire.  Patent law has to strike a balance between the competing interests of the company to recoup their investments costs and make a fair profit for their novel design against the interest of the public in being able to improve existing technology and make it more accessible.

In this case for instance, Moonman also makes a clipless version.  I honestly don‚Äôt know if Pilot does, but the times I‚Äôve googled around for one, I haven‚Äôt been able to find one.  So a person who prefers the vanishing point without a clip might benefit from that design change. Certainly the reduced price of Moonman makes the technology more accessible to a wider group of people. This is built into the copyright and patent system for good reason.  If you have a novel idea/design your are rightfully given an exclusive right to sell that design for a finite amount of time to make the return on your investment and profit from (presumably) contributing to society in some way.

However, your idea did not occur in a vacuum, you are standing on the shoulders of giants, benefiting from previous ideas and the infrastructure of society writ large.  As such, after your exclusivity period is over, your patent becomes public domain, allowing others to build on (or copy) your idea.  Just because you came up with a good idea once doesn‚Äôt mean that your estate or corporation gets to milk it for the rest of human existence.

It is that expiry of exclusivity that allows technology to march on by forcing companies to innovate or die, or at least allow others to build on a good idea or make it more accessible. I think a lot of it has to do with usability versus fashion as well. Pens are designed to be used, so functionality (particularly of the VP) matters more than the style. The functionality is long out of patent.

Personally though, I refuse to buy the knockoffs. If you want to copy the functionality of the VP, I'm fine with that. Use the expired patents. But they copied literally everything. They copied the proprietary pilot cartridge sizing. They copied the style of the clip. The parts are literally swappable with each other. I would like that only if it was due to standardization, but it's not. Moonman literally is adding nothing to the pen except for cheap labor. I find it leaky too when using the converter but when I filled up a cartridge with a more saturated ink, the burped ink is noticeably less Yes, some of the nib units have been found to be leaky, this is a known defect and you aren‚Äôt the only one with this issue. You should request an exchange if you can. ~~A lot~~ All of my MoonMan pens have broken badly. I spent enough money on them I could have bought a higher quality pen, and saved myself the grief. I‚Äôve only found that to happen if I let the nib snap back forcefully when I retract it. Have you tried clicking it more gently or is it actually leaking? The Moonman matte coating feels worse than the Pilot IMO. It‚Äôs almost tacky feeling. They seems to be specific to the matte black version. Any other is high quality. It‚Äôs brass on the Moonman also.

I haven‚Äôt found the VP‚Äôs coating to come off quickly, perhaps it varies by finish? It‚Äôs not IP theft. [we‚Äôve covered this before](https://reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/qvzwwz/_/hkzp01b/?context=1)

Edit: contrary to below poster, I link to my old comment because it provides a succinct summary of the issue. I‚Äôm not expecting everyone to have read it‚Äîthe question of IP law is discussed all the time on this sub, basically every time another clone pen is posted like an A1 or Jinhao 80.

Essentially, please [don‚Äôt call it theft](https://youtu.be/IeTybKL1pM4) if you aren‚Äôt prepared to back up your characterization of copying as a crime. It most likely isn't slimmer.  The A1 is much heftier and just as girthy.  If you want slimmer, look to the decimo. I didn't realize they existed. Might need another one. ?üòâ so the ones form the 90s have the faceted clip?

That is what I am looking for! What does faceted mean? Just stumbled upon the Moonman A2, which also has a faceted body. Single color choices for the barrel, but you can choose between either black or chrome hardware. Western-made nibs such as Lamy, Jowo, Bock have EF nibs that write thicker compared to Japanese-made EF nibs such as Pilot, Platinum, Sailor. 

The actual line widths vary between pens, paper, and inks but Japanese EF nibs write close to 0.38mm tip ballpoint, while Western EF nibs write close to 0.5mm tip ballpoint. Values are just estimates as EF is a tough grind to perfect In lamen terms Japanese nibs are one size smaller than western nibs. So that Japanese F nib is more compared to a Western EF nib. In OP case, that Japanese EF is like an extra extra fine western nib yes, the A1 is not perfectly aligned but not prominent enough to cause any writing issues Seems like you've hit a significant point - trying to emulate/draw from the design of others is broadly more acceptable than a straight up ripoff, logos and all.

I think the relatively small size of this community helps somewhat, the economy of scale just isn't present for obviously infringing knockoff products - it makes more sense to do a similar product that can be sold openly through normal channels.

Not to say that we're immune from such things, just that there are better opportunities for product fraud in other areas - like fashion. Ahhhh, spoken like a man who does not know about the quintessential black Chanel quilted bag. The most coveted pieces are not about the newest and hottest trends and if you refer to Crazy Rich Asians, many truly stylish people wear classic, vintage pieces and don‚Äôt follow the herd. (The herd therefore wants to follow those people.) 

Yes, I agree with you that they are not explicitly counterfeited with brand names on them.

I just can‚Äôt think of a legit, noble reason with regards to them making identical copies of designer pens, though. They didn‚Äôt start the business to nobly fulfill the designer pen dreams of us poor middle class folk who shop at Forever 21 and can only afford Forever 21 pens. 

It does seem to be a bit dodgy to me, but yep sure, I‚Äôll buy if I like it. I think people are more outraged at the general ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù of it, rather than the actual technicalities. 

‚ÄúJust because you can do it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right to do it!‚Äù 

Like, there really isn‚Äôt any good reason (other than to make money) for Jinhao and Moonman to purposefully make a 100% identical copy of those pens. In fast fashion, for example, they at least try to tweak the original designer‚Äôs design to some extent, but to be fair, Forever 21 often copied designer runway pieces in an identical manner and it seemed to be acceptable. 

The Chinese are well-known to be excellent at making knockoffs of everything, and it certainly has extended to pens. I have personally seen genuine Nike shoes taken apart so that they can study and replicate every piece of the shoe (they do that with Herm√®s bags as well), and visited some of the fake goods areas. (I‚Äôm Chinese but not from China.) They are very practical, scrappy business people. They make what people want to buy. ‚ÄúHaha but is it ethical‚Äù is not a priority in China.  

Perhaps their penchant for copying is deservedly perceived in a bad light, since we ‚Äúknow‚Äù that designer fashion knockoffs are bad/unethical/aid criminal activity and money laundering. 

I don‚Äôt have a conclusion really - but I suspect the Chinese take great pride in their ability to produce 100% identical copies of American designs. It‚Äôs like a game for them. 

I might have just bought Taobao copies of very well-known Diamine and Sailor inks. So normally I‚Äôd agree but here‚Äôs another side of the story: some people cannot or won‚Äôt spend $150+ on a pen. I don‚Äôt think Moonman/Majohn is really taking customers away from Pilot by offering A1 at the fifth of the price, they‚Äôre just catering to a different audience. If someone wants something like a VP without the price tag, I don‚Äôt see a problem with that. No one is at a loss.

And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who has the VP but not the A1. Although I‚Äôd personally buy both. There is a small hole under the feed under the nib area, it‚Äôs square in shape. I‚Äôve filled my moonman with some thick silicone grease and mine have never leaked. I found a YouTuber (forget his name) who‚Äôs pen leaked profusely and this was his solution. I think the little trap door actually drags across the top of the nib when retracting and extending. I have had to use a long cotton swab several times to clean the ink out of the barrel. Yeah, I've heard this too. Seems to be something to do with the matte coating application process. Yeah it was a known issue for the matte black versions. I guess they changed formulations and for a while the paint was less resistant. Seams like it has changed innrecent years though there are some aspects of the pen (breather whole, ring, spring mechanism, clip attachment, etc) that are subtly different from the original one. same way how fast fashion change about 7 design aspects from a reference to get away with it [deleted] Fine, let me rephrase it then. Instead of creating a whole new, unique pen that only the Chinese can make, they decide to blatantly reverse engineer an already established product. A product that another company that has been around for over 100 years have put in the blood, sweat, and tears to make. No, it‚Äôs still stealing a design regardless of the law. 

These companies repeatedly copy and steal designs whether or not their country forces them to honor other nations IP protection laws. The body isn‚Äôt round. It has about 18 facets. Catches light beautifully. I kinda wish it was metal since I don't like how cheap plastic pens feel after like 5 bucks /u/moonstonewish, everything said above by /u/dangkaniel is correct, in general, but there are some Japanese pens that tend to be more like western nibs, good examples are the Pilot Varsity or the Platinum Plasir, both tend to have a bolder nib for the size than other pens in the brand.   
    
So, trust but verify when you get a nib.   
    
Another good example, the Moonman A-1 is a 0.4mm nib, but a wet one, so it tends to write bolder than the nib size would indicate.  A good dry ink will help bring it back to writing like an bold EF and as expected for stated size of 0.4mm (it is sold by nib size in China and as an 'EF' when sold to western people). I see. Thank you for the information. I appreciate it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Just as a note, the phrase is ""layman's terms"" when you're referring to simple language that anyone can understand. :) Right! You used that word ""style"" which is like 465,004th on my list of things to care about.  So yeah, I'm not going to analyze that realm right.  You also said ""designer pen""... that's as opposed to what, ""utilitarian pen""?  I bought some super cheap pens at Five Below to practice nib grinding.    The ones that use Lamy cues to I guess ""look respectably fancy"" are OK cheap pens, where the truly anonymous pens that follow no leader are pretty much junk, functionally.   All are unbranded - the package just has the name of a Chinese importer - I doubt the 5 or 6 types even have the same manufacturer.  Example - both the ones that have caps inspired by a Safari or All-Star, the cap measurements are subtly different.

""Forever 21 pens"" - so I was briefly excited to think there might be *another* store in my town with SoMe SoRt of fountain pen - thus far it's Office Depot and Five Below.  Then I realized you're using an analogy.   Oh, well ;-).

I honestly have to scratch my head at the motivations and methods of influencers, and designers.  No doubt one reason there's a growing bald spot.  I get that fancy fashion folk want to be out in front of the herd - but don't they *want* a herd?  If for no other reason than so they can be superior to someone whose little black bag came from the trunk of a '93 LeBaron out on the bypass, under a sign proclaiming Genuine Faux Channel and Coach Koar Bags?

In this subreddit I don't get much of the superiority vibe - I'm sure there are some such folk, but Reddit does not select for ""pretentious"" :-) If real snootiness comes out, so do the snark-knives.  It's fair enough if you drive a Maserati, to look down on the guy with a VW kit-car that's Maserati-shaped... I guess.  Me - I look at the putt-putt version and enjoy the bumper stickers on it, and wonder if I had one could I put a trailer hitch on it.  And I think of the news photo showing some poor guy's exotic car sinking after hurricane Ian, whereas VW Beetles supposedly CAN float...   I'm not in the market for a VP, and  honestly, the A1 is *above* my current pen limit.  I'm using a Pilot Metro as my upper budget bound - I might could find a used A1 on r/pen_swap for under the going rate for a Metro, if I wanted to... [checks] yep; 20 bucks.  Great.  I doubt I could find a VP for that which had not spent weeks in the floaty-Ferrari, then got run over by the VW.

I see some people happy to spend large lucre on really nice pens *because they make them happy*, and ""they write nice"", and most of those seem to be ok with me having a happy place at the couch-cushion pocket-change level.  Wrestling this ramble back around to the point (B-nib, not EF); nah, the clonemasters don't want to make my plebe pen-dreams come true, they just want to make a buck.  The invisible hand of that economic impulse is attached to an invisible elbow in the ribs of complacent elder manufacturers, who thus have a teensy incentive to improve their offerings and earn my buck instead.  NewParker isn't doing that - by most reports Chinese copies of OldParker 51s are often better pens than the NewParker copies of OldParker 51s. Whether or not you're willing to pay the prices is a completely different consideration IMO. I filter away knockoffs on principle first, and THEN consider the cost/benefit ratio. I don't consider the cost of a knockoff in the calculation at all.

If I were looking at pens in the roughly $50 price range, and I had specific requirements for quick draw, then the pens that draw my attention simply have non-threaded caps (snap cap, slip-on, magnetic, etc).

If I **required** a click pen for some artificial reason, and I refused to pay more than $100 ... pilot does sell a steel-nibbed version, and teh platinum curadas also exists. If I had a max limit of $50 (which is, btw, also huge for a pen remember), then there is also the option of... waiting and saving up. Can I ask, do you fill that hole with the silicon grease? Storage probably makes a difference too. And to me, the VP is one of the few pens in my collection that doesn‚Äôt get babied because it‚Äôs a purpose bought work horse. So it doesn‚Äôt matter where I put it down, how I store it or if I drop it. (Nib retracted of course). 

Despite being left in the sun, dropped dozens and dozens of times, spun on tables, left unprotected in a pile of other pens and heavily used for the last 7 years, by blue on rhodium shows little signs of wear. There‚Äôs nothing to get away with. The design of the Capless is long out of design protection, it‚Äôs legal to copy it, exactly down to the millimeter if you want, as long as you don‚Äôt write PILOT on it. [deleted] This characterization of ‚Äúblatant‚Äù and ‚Äúblood, sweat, and tears‚Äù is emotional and not based on fact. Companies like Pilot and Lamy make these designs knowing that the exclusivity will expire in 25 years. It‚Äôs built into their R&D plans. They aren‚Äôt offended when other companies copy an old design, they aren‚Äôt caught out by it, and there is no rational reason for normal fountain pen users to be either. [deleted] Your comment was a work of art and thoroughly enjoyed on my part, but I might take some time to reply although I‚Äôve read it a few times and laughed every single time ?üòÜ Gotta do weekend things with the kid, let me come back and respond!! Fair enough. I just believe there‚Äôs a market for everyone. I‚Äôd have a problem with the pen if it were branded as Pilot and sold as one of course! Yes, no leak in months Of having them, even after dropping one on concrete [deleted] I think some  get mad because they spend so much money on the original while someone els gets the ""same"" product for a craction of the price. Kinda like the guy who drives up to the front of the traffic and cuts in while we are waiting patiently lol That's not the point. Like I said, it still would have at least been more respectable if they just made their own, unique pen. They took the easy way out. Why don't *they* put in the R&D? You know why? Because they know somebody else will I'm truly sorry for offending you. No offense was meant. And if I may, what culture are you referring to? I'd love to learn more about your usage of the term. I hope someone with better memory than me comes in and explains again how knockoffs tend to have a neutral to positive effect on luxury  brands. I have half a brain cell  left but this is definitely something that has been analyzed and studied. Gotcha, thank you!! LOL.  Do you really believe that anyone buying this Majohn at $25 is now going to NOT buy a Pilot VP?

It's lazy for them to steal the design this blatantly, but Pilot isn't losing any business over this any more than Lamy is losing L2K sales because of the JinHao 80.  They might look the same but they aren't the same or we would suddenly be seeing the OEMs pop up all over Pen_Swap and eBay as people rushed to sell their VP for $130 so they can replace it with an A1 and collect a cool $100, too. It doesn‚Äôt have to be commendable, and it might be distasteful. That‚Äôs a question of opinion. My only point is that it is factually not stealing. There is actualy a video on youtube explaining whybthe chinese do this. 

En gros 

Its a socialist / communist phenomena where all must be equal. Therefore creativity is punished. So a way to get the creativity out of their system is to copy and change pre existing ideas that are already socialy acceptable to their liking. Thats why the moon man A1 also has a clipless version. 

Its much more complicated than simply copying. 

In addition, they are not occupying the same space in the market. They are ironicaly democratizing fountain pens because they make it much more accesable to lower income individuals. 

Someone who wants a premium gold nib capless will still buy a pilot even if they buy a moonman first.

Actualy in in the early 2000 companies like adolbe would shadow release software keys to their products like photoshop because they knew that those who pirated their software would learn it and eventualy buy it when they became professional. It was a whole strategy. 

Also to be fair, western cultures copy all the time. In music we often sample from other artists and change it slightly to our liking. And there is nothing anyone can do to about it. Cause evertthing influences everything. 

Thats why the katy perry lawsuit about the chord progression was ridiculus. I disagree with this because cutting in is quite an asshole move because the people behind have to physically wait longer and their day is affected in terms of physical time. 

However, buying an original vs. buying a copy, does not physically affect the original buyer in the same way in terms of causing their day‚Äôs plans to be affected.

Just a thought xD I think it‚Äôs the brainwashing that big media companies have been shoving down our throats for decades that copying is bad and somehow comparable to piracy (in which people actually lose lives, talk about an exaggerated comparison). People don‚Äôt realize‚Äî after being fed this crap for their whole lives‚Äîthat it doesn‚Äôt make sense. Copying doesn‚Äôt take it away from the original owner, and there are legally mandated periods of exclusivity for creators after which copying is allowed, but somehow people make it a moral issue when it isn‚Äôt one. They did make a clipless version which Pilot has not done for whatever reason. Because originality (or for that matter, respectability) is not the only purpose of bringing things to market. Not everyone has 150 USD to spend on a Capless. Moonman is giving people a choice to buy a cheaper and less well-built version if that‚Äôs what they can afford. This is a cycle that happens for all kinds of products. Not every plastic food container is made by Tupperware or Rubbermaid anymore.

In fact, the usual effect of the existence of a cheaper option is that the market for such a product expands, meaning the original product also gets more sales from awareness. Just on this sub you‚Äôll find a lot of people who bought an A1 and liked it so much they bought a Capless. 

You are free to find copying distasteful, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs actually anything wrong with it. It‚Äôs a normal part of product ideas being reused and remixed. I don‚Äôt have great memory and I‚Äôm also lazy but here‚Äôs one example: https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/knockoff-appeal-counterfeits-can-boost-sales-of-the-real-thing/381801/ Source on ‚Äúcreativity is punished‚Äù in socialism & communism? I agree with you. 

I remember those piracy ads that they would show on vhs and dvds back in the day. 

""You wouldnt kill someone , so why why would you pirate"" 

Lol wut? 

Further up in the thread i mentionned how adolbe used to release keys to their products as a buisnees strategy. 

Kids use pirated photoshop-> they learn the software-> they grow up become proffesionals and buy the product 

Actualy to not copy after the copyright would actualy be detremental to innovation and the market would ultimatly stagnate Adjacent if not exact (conformity vs. individualism being related to copy vs. innovate), the proverb variously attributed to Japan and China is that ""the nail that sticks up will be hammered down"". So perhaps in addition to socialism/collectivism there's just an oriental-society mindset in play. Sure, there's innovation going on - but a lean toward conformity could be a decent generalization.";;
My people. I have sampled the vanishing point kool-aid AND I‚ÄôLL BE POURING MYSELF ANOTHER GLASS!;Pilot Vanishing Point Stripes in M. Had my sister haul it back from Yoseka in New York.;"The day I got my Decimo M, I immediately ordered a Decimo F.  They're wonderful pens. Hey there. ?üòÄ 

Welcome to the VP Stripes Crew!

I have one. It's my favorite fountain pen. I have it in medium. My only problem with vanishing point is that the ink capacity is so small Gz. Looks great but is it heavy? Oh! Oh! Oh! You inspire me, o Vanishing Point lover. And now I am heading to a store to get another one for myself! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

P.S. Enjoy your second glass. And third. And fourth ‚Ä¶ ?üòÑ Out of all the FPs I own, the only one I hate/regret is the vanishing point. It has a terrible reservoir, the EF is WAY too scratchy, it dries out in seemingly minutes (exaggerating for effect), never fills all the way (which makes the piece of crap CON-40 converter even worse, even if using a snorkel filler).

Not to bash anyone, I‚Äôm glad other people like it so much, I wish I did too; but for a VP style it is just bad from my perspective. The lammy dialog is much better for me.

Sincerely hoping it is better for you than it is for me due to the apparent wrath of the VP gods I have maligned horribly! I recently got an A2. 

It‚Äôs an OK pen. 

But all those videos comparing it to Pilot are completely insane. Congratulations! This is indeed a very beautiful pen that pen is sick. I've thought of buying it before. It will probably be my next vanishing point but not my next pen. I like it more than the raden ones. That‚Äôs a really beautiful VP. I fell in to this hole a year or so ago.  Now I‚Äôm on a mission to collect all of the limited editions.  The 2023 will be out this month.  I‚Äôm missing four of the back issues. THAT'S A NICE METAL FP ! I just got my first Decimo the other day, and I am VERY tempted to go back and get another in an EF. I just wish the Decimo had as many fun limited editions as the VP! Pretty line variation Welcome to the club!

I have 6 VPs and waiting on my (final?) 7th & 8th later this month.

Looking foward to seeing which other ones you pick up in the future. ?üòâ I justciuldnt get past the upside-downism of the barrell Perhaps upside-down ishment? Nice!  The Pilot VP is on my wish list. I like the clicking. I haven‚Äôt bought a new pen in many months‚Ä¶ but I have been looking at VPs in the last couple days. ?üò¨ Another VP fan is created! ?üò??üëç

And I can confirm: you can't have just one. They have new VP variant with a twist knob I believe. I‚Äôm thinking of getting that too Got myself a Fermo M a couple of weeks ago, and it's become my goto. Such a lovely writer It‚Äôs beautiful. It‚Äôs just simply beautiful. 

Slippery!‚Ä¶..but oh so beautiful!

I‚Äôm trying to figure out which variant will join this. And whether I should go for a broad or fine in that one. Any suggestion on either front? Not OP, but the VP sits super comfortably in my hand. Not bulky or heavy at all. I also got used to the clip grip quickly. ![gif](giphy|qgri3D9sTwCUGMcT8L) I think the nib materials are completely different.  That‚Äôs more of a take more abuse kind of pen.  The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that it‚Äôs not even an homage it‚Äôs pretty much a rip off of the design of the pilot. This is about a third the price for the raden ones. I love those as well but I don‚Äôt have to stomach to spend that much money. Thank you. Quite slippery though! Wait, is this a limited edition? Thank you! Haha. I‚Äôm thinking of a Fermo. I usually cap myself at 2 of the same pen. But I have broken that rule before‚Ä¶. Neither could I for the longest time. But I eventually came around. Particularly this version. You should get one for sure! If you‚Äôre in ?üáÆ?üá≥ Hobby one Japan on amazon has like 40 percent off and there‚Äôs some VPs available for half price. I‚Äôve honestly bought it because it looks pretty. It‚Äôs a slippery sucker to write with. That's the Fermo! The Fermo. It‚Äôs not new‚Ä¶it‚Äôs actually on its way out, discontinued, I‚Äôve been told. Still available now, but you might want to jump on it. Which I do recommend because they‚Äôre fantastic. :) Get the black matte VP. It‚Äôs not slippery! Do you have a Pilot Fermo?

They're good It depends on your handwriting. But... hear me out... if you ever want to get a custom nib grind, B is a good starting point because it gives the nibmeister enough tipping material to work with. I have a Decimo with a Chinese calligraphy nib grind that started as a stock B nib. The great thing about these pens is that you can get replacement nib units.  


ETA: You get better ink capacity with a Pilot cartridge. Majohn empty cartridges with plugs for A1 and A2 also fit - and so do their nib units. Yup. It‚Äôs rhodium plated brass. I would call is substantial but not heavy Pilot make a steel nib which is basically the same as the gold but in steel. 

It‚Äôs about 8,000 yen, so about twice as much as the A1. [deleted] That‚Äôs too bad.  Though it‚Äôs pretty enough to just stare at.  You don‚Äôt need to use it. LOL I'm not sure, as I'm not familiar with this specific VP. But they do come out with an [annual limited edition ](https://www.gouletpens.com/blogs/fountain-pen-blog/pilot-vanishing-point-limited-edition-history) and have generally done more fun colors with the VP than the Decimo It's an ""unofficial"" limited edition. Pilot tested the market back in 2018-2019.  They marketed a limited number of these to analyze market interest. Jumping right away! Oh yeah. I‚Äôve been through all 5 stages of grief with the con40 so I‚Äôve been refilling them routinely. 

honestly. I like writing with broad nibs. I feel they show off ink the best. 75 percent of my collection is in broad the rest is medium and I have one, yes, ONE F nib. Which is in a custom 74 Really?  The stores I. My region don‚Äôt carry the steel version at all. Now I‚Äôm really curious why you don‚Äôt think the A2 compares. 

I‚Äôve bought a few moonmans but honestly turned two of them into pilot parallel ink tankers. And another houses a Leonardo flex nib. I have a few Parker 51 looking pens but the Nibs on those are trash so I never use them. 

Is it the luck of the draw with the nib or what? If I had any vintage dealers in my vicinity, I would‚Äôve only gone for those or even pre owned. Unfortunately. Where I live. I gotta spend retail. 
As a matter of fact the vintage pens have a better aesthetic most of the time. I‚Äôve bought it for the notetaking and the innovative mechanism design. For that it will more than suffice. 

I‚Äôll always have the C823 for the usual long writing sessions I'm on the other end of the nib size preference spectrum. For me, B nibs are my outliers. The nib in mine is beautiful. 

But the mechanism is kind of brute force. 

The nib itself pushes the trap door open and there‚Äôs resistance. 

On all of my VPs the trap door opens ahead of the nib coming though it and doesn‚Äôt touch the nib or feed. 

It‚Äôs also a smoother and more refined knock. 

I mean the moonman IS good for the price. But it‚Äôs not really a Pilot. 

I find the finishing on my Pilots are better too. 

I‚Äôm in Japan so we have a lot more options for Pilot pens over here; generally VP and 74 can be found on the used market for around 7,000 yen; so I have almost the entire range of 74; I used to even have the C and the Ms, but they just didn‚Äôt make sense to own. I envy you. The options in Japan are so much better. I‚Äôm in India and luckily my sister was in her way back from NY. Otherwise this version isn‚Äôt available at any retailers. The c‚Äôs and m‚Äôs?  I‚Äôm guessing custom and maki-e? I considered this one but it‚Äôs extremely expensive. 

In the end I went for the black one. 

I definitely would like this one too though. Course and music. 

Basically BBB size and 1.9 italic on the Custom 74. Oh. I get it. I‚Äôm tempted by a music nib but I‚Äôm also afraid it‚Äôll end up being a novelty rather than something I would use. 

Edit: Jesus. This keyboard! Yes, it was fun for a few moments but in the end I didn‚Äôt use it. 

If you want to try basically the same thing, get a Lamy 1.5/1.9. 

It‚Äôs the same kind of soft italic. I have the lamy 1.5 it‚Äôs not tipped. So I literally have to drag it by force across the page.

Pilot Custom 823 vs Pilot Vanishing Point for my first gold nib;"Hey everyone.

My birthday is coming up and I want to splurge on a new FP, and specifically my first gold nib FP.

I am between the **Pilot custom 823** and the **Pilot Vanishing Point**, both in Fine nib, but I would be open to any other suggestions!

I currently own the following:

* TWSBI Diamond 580 ALR Navy Blue <F>
* TWSBI ECO Indigo Blue Bronze <M>
* Lamy Safari Dark Dusk <M>
* Lamy AL-Star <F>
* Kaweco SKYLINE Sport Black <F>

While I started with Medium nibs, I realized I like a fine nib more, maybe except the Kaweco Fine nib which is a bit too scratchy for me.";"I personally don't consider these two pens in the same category.¬†

The 823 is a much better pen overall, in my opinion, but much less a quick notetaker. It's better in the long writing sessions category.

VP, on the other hand, has a tiny converter that doesn't even work well, is too heavy for long writing sessions, but is excellent at taking a quick short note, like during a meeting or something. A Pilot Decimo is functionally the same as the VP, but thinner and lighter (also slightly less durable).

What are you looking for specifically in a gold nib pen?  Because that will impact the pen you choose... and that folks will recommend. Why exactly these two pens? They are almost opposites of each other. I have tried/own one fine 823 and three Capless/VP, one fine gold nib, one extra fine gold nib, one fine steel nib. 

I prefer both the extrafine gold and the fine steel nib over the Capless fine gold. I find the latter insufferably mushy. The EF sings a bit but isn't necessarily scratchy. The steel fine is a perfect EDC pen for me. 

The 823 F nib, at least in my example, is kinda dry. I was shocked when I first tested it using a dryer ink. I was able to have it tweaked a little and it now works fine, at least with inks that aren't overly dry. I usually prefer fine and extrafine nibs but would eventually like to try the 823 with a medium nib. I don't hate the Pilot Metropolitan medium nibs. They aren't much finer than a Lamy fine nib. I figure it would be similar for the 823.

For writing experience, I really love my Custom 742 with a soft fine nib. Much prefer it over the 823 for writing at home. I have the pilot custom 823 in F.  Its a dream with a thinner Japanese ink.   Thicker inks‚Ä¶not so much.  I love the 823 and if it came in more colors I would buy them all.   


The 823, as others have mentioned, is not for jotting down notes in the moment.   

I think I have a LAMY in M if you would like to see a direct comparison with the F and M 823 823 all day long.  These are very different pens.  The VP is a more bouncy writer and honestly I see it as more of a show pen.  The 823 is a firmer nib, a piston-filler with a large capacity, and is also very stylish yet understated.  Personally, love fountain pens that are either piston or vacuum filled.  It means the pen is more than just a vessel for an ink cartridge and a nib.  Yes, the nib is the most important part of any pen.  You won't be disappointed with the 823.  I have a lot of pens, and I really believe that, between Pelican and Pilot, you have some of the best functional and elegant pens.  I don't think you can go wrong with either pen, but I think the 823 is just awesome on another level than the VP. Not a fan of either one. If you're seriously considering a VP, do yourself a favor and get the Jinhao clone first to make sure you enjoy the shape. The clip on the section can be an easy dealbreaker for **a lot** of people.

The 823 and VP, as others have said, are also in different categories. One is a workhorse pen meant for extended writing sessions without refills, while the other is best used for quick notes, like in meetings or classes. The VP design can be hit and miss with people. I reckon it's more of a miss with most people unless you're looking for that super quick note taking. The 823 is a brilliant pen and you'd unlikely be disappointed but a different beast to the VP. I'd recommend trialling the VP first or buying a cheaper Jinhao 10 to trial out the form factor before you spend the bigger bucks. My thoughts exactly. Same.

Yes, the nib is the most important part of any pen.  You won't be disappointed with the 823.  I have a lot of pens, and I really believe that, between Pelican and Pilot, you have some of the best functional and elegant pens.  I don't think you can go wrong with either pen, but I think the 823 is just awesome on another level than the VP. Not a fan of either one. If you're seriously considering a VP, do yourself a favor and get the Jinhao clone first to make sure you enjoy the shape. The clip on the section can be an easy dealbreaker for **a lot** of people.

The 823 and VP, as others have said, are also in different categories. One is a workhorse pen meant for extended writing sessions without refills, while the other is best used for quick notes, like in meetings or classes. The VP design can be hit and miss with people. I reckon it's more of a miss with most people unless you're looking for that super quick note taking. The 823 is a brilliant pen and you'd unlikely be disappointed but a different beast to the VP. I'd recommend trialling the VP first or buying a cheaper Jinhao 10 to trial out the form factor before you spend the bigger bucks. My thoughts exactly. Same. Yup Agreed";;
New pen arrived! Pilot vanishing point ;"I got this beauty from an auction website and I was so happy when I got the winning bid!  

This is my first pilot vanishing point. I did use my Majohn A1's before but im so happy got this version in the colors that I wanted! 

This is the limited edition 30th Taiwan anniversary pilot vanishing point. 
";"This is lovely. I have a Pilot FERMO and I love it a lot. It's one of my favourites Oh! I have one of them myself, love it dearly. No photo ever does it justice. Ohhh sexy
Love the matt finish Beautiful green color. I am a sucker for a green fountain pen. Luckily for me its gold trim, which I am not a fan of. At least I am safe for now. What ink are you planning to use? Are you matchy, matchy? Gorgeous‚Ä¶ I so often overlook the elegance of green and gold. I feel like I have a number of fairly notable pens. However, one of my very best writing pens is my medium VP. Smooth as glass but no hard starts or skipping. Perfectly wet. I want that pen to last forever. Nice. I picked up the Capless two days ago. It is the version of the VP with an alloy nib. I love the matte VPs that Pilot has done recently including this one. The other I'm aware of is the Whisk(e)y VP. Hope they do some more! I bought my matte black vanishing point a few months ago. I‚Äôd marry it, but my wife would be insanely jealous. Also I‚Äôd have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of my life. I love the pilot and curidas for their click fountain pens. And I love their fine and extra fine points. They are Japanese size nibs. I have 2 pens coming in next week. Oh gosh, I totally want one of these bad boys. Wish they were still available! Gorgeous ?ü§© I adored my Pilot VPs with the EF point. That EF nib made note-writing a dream. 

I hope the coworkers who stole them fully appreciated them and didn't splay the nib! 

(I have a Namiki Falcon SEF now, and am self-employed these days, lol.) Hi :) If anyone is looking to sell theirs I would love to buy it! ?üíö I had never seen the Pilot Fermo before and it looks so cool! And thank you, I just inked the vanishing point and it writes lovely It's such a pretty hue of green, it's more turquoise leaning than I expected. But a classic green and gold combo always looks pretty. Did you buy it when it was first announced or did you also get it second hand? Yes! It's lovely to hold and it feels quite sturdy and nice to hold. Writing is also pleasant Thank you for your comment! I have green ink hanging rice by troublemaker in the pen and yes I like to be a bit matchy. But the current ink is a bit dry so I might change it out to a diamine green ink for better flow. Thank you! It's one of my favorite combo's in a pen, it's just so classy Happy to hear that the VP is a favorite of yours! I can't wait to use mine more often How do you like it so far? I like the feel of this pen, it's heavier than the majohn ones I own. But it feels very luxurious Enjoy your pens when they arrive!   
I felt so happy when I got it at the auction site, and it's a true workhorse, ideal to take notes with at work Thank you so much! I do not have the pen anymore but it was nice seeing your comment and having the ability to look at this pen again There's four different modelsof Pilot's retractable nibs, the Vanishing Point, Capless (og Japanese VP, also comes in steel alloy nib), Decimo, and Fermo. They're all pretty similar with minor differences in design and materials. I baught it when it came out, even had it shipped to Germany from Taiwan to me. Because I so fell in love with the colors. Currently inked with an Edelstein green. It took a while to get used to it. I think all my pens have European style nibs so the Pilot fine wrote much more narrow than I am used to. Add to that most of my inks are fairly dry, this made the pen feel scratchy at first. I first used Noodler's Air Corps, then I switched to Diamine Aurora Borealis, both made the pen write super dry. I then tried Diamine Sargasso Sea (my wettest ink) and it worked very very well. I currently have it loaded with Noodler's 54th Massachusetts which works well.

  Once I found the right ink, the Capless write very well and it is half the price of the gold nib version. Omg why? Was it not a good writer? I just came across it online on someone‚Äôs YouTube review and now I‚Äôm in love. Plus it‚Äôs my favorite color combo so now I‚Äôm a bit obsessed. I just got the Capless with the alloy nib two days ago. I am used to Lamy's so it was a big change to a much finer nib. The major difference with the Fermo is that it twists open/closed as opposed to clicking. It's my favorite of the lot. Unfortunately the colors are limited and its difficult to get outside of Japan I loved the color and accent colors but I felt like the pen was a little heavy for me. I did use a majohn vanishing point before and I now use the Jinhao 10 (another vanishing point) more often. I got this pen for the limited edition but I did not write with it so it was being kept in the box. 

  
I just felt like using my other pens more, so nothing wrong with the pen, I just liked the majohn/jinhao since they are less heavier and easier for me to use. 

  
But ofcourse get this pen if you are able too! It looks even better irl I keep being tempted by the Capless special alloy, but also keep reminding myself that I don‚Äôt use my Decimo enough to justify getting another capless! I can totally see your point and I‚Äôm sure whoever bought it from you is glad you decided to rehome it. I don‚Äôt do a ton of writing but if I did I guess weight would be more of a factor then too for me.

If price is the same: Lamy Dialog 3 vs Pilot Capless Vanishing Point;"I have recently been fascinated by capless fountain pens and am keen to add one to my collection as one of my two main pens to go alongside my Pilot Custom 823 F. 

I have been looking on this subreddit and other places online for comparisons between the two, but I am still undecided. One of the biggest differentiators seems to be the price, but I have found a new Palladium (my preferred colourway) Dialog 3 in either EF or F for the same price of the Pilot Red Birch I would buy (in F). 

I would appreciate any input.";"Dialog 3 has historically had QC and hard start issues. Pilot Fermo with a similar twist mechanism is better. How about platinum Curidas?
If price is the same I would look at barrel material, length, width to choose. I‚Äôm basically an 8 year old cosplaying as a middle-aged adult‚Ä¶the Dialog‚Äôs twist it‚Äôs THERE, twist it‚Äôs NOT is always so much fun ‚Äî I feel likeJames Bond when I do that ;)

For Proper Adults, YMMV Pilot two months ago and I'm totally loving it. Highly recommend it. I have both, and I am a Lamy lover: the VP is the way to go. I've had a lot of issues with hard starts with my Dialog. I almost never have those issues with a VP unless I don't use it for weeks.  I also prefer the weight and width of the VP. The Dialog is a bit clunky for me. The twist mechanism is cool, thouvb. I own a Pilot Vanishing point Fermo, a Lamy Dialog 3, and a Lamy Dialog CC.  I will never purchase a Lamy product again.  Dialog 3 nothing but problems and no Lamy support,  twist mechanism binds, and leaking through the pocket clip.  I will say that I loved this pen and how it wrote when it worked, probably my favorite nib <F>of all of my fountain pens.  I reached out Lamy after 2 years of ownership and was told that it could not be repaired and that I was out of warranty.  I can accept fault for not reaching out sooner, but no repair service available for a $300 pen!!

I then made the mistake of believing that the fix was new model, the Lamy Dialog CC.  I purchased one and it was fine until i started getting dry starts and now the entire nib unit has a little click while writing, I just emailed Lamy service again, this pen is less than a year old.

  
My pilot VP Fermo,  love it!  It has a twist mechanism, similar to the Lamy Dialog, although a different execution.  I am always surprised that I hear less about the twist VP (Fermo) than about the knock VP.  The twist  affords me one handed opening which is great when jotting notes.   I had a knock type VP and always struggled to reliably one hand thumb press the long VP plunger.   Over 3 years old and not one issue.  Never dries out, always starts,  the twist mechanism always works.  It writes very nice, my only problem is that my nib preference sits somewhere between a Japanese fine and medium.   I have purchased and used both fine and medium nibs in this pen but stay with the fine. The only issue that I have is that the clip has slightly loosened which I feel is normal as I carry and use this pen just about daily at work.  Oh and the price is way better.

I will admit that the Dialog 3 has one of my favorite nibs, and I prefer the aesthetics.  It was a dream to write with until then issues appeared, early and often.  The leaking was the last straw.  I actually found this post researching a fix for the leak in my Lamy Dialog 3 after emailing Lamy for warranty repair on my CC.  My opinion now is that Lamy makes crap and cares less about customer satisfaction, spent too much money with them, but never again.  Good luck with your decision and sorry for the rant, hope it helps. To me the point of a retractable fountain pen is ease of use during quick note taking. The vanishing point reigns supreme here and it being usable one handed is part of why. The twist nature of the dialog 3 feels a lot clunkier to me. Dialog is not worth it, pilot is amazing. I realise it's a stupid thing to say but it looks horrible to me aesthetically! Thanks. It seems to be such a loved pen. The only big detractor would be the ink capacity. I am not super keen on filling it up every other day, or playing with needles to refill cartridges. I'll do it if it's the better pen, just not super keen on it. Thanks for this. It seems the Lamys are much worse than the VPs. Thanks, I understand that being able to use it one handed is a big benefit. In my case, while I will appreciate the speed, I do not take notes so it would not be the main deciding factor, which is why I am so confused with all the options. I would even consider a capped pen if it took very little to uncap, like the Pelikan M200 with its 3/4 rotation. The Pilot appeals a lot to me because I just got the 823 and just love the feel when writing. I realise they have different nibs and the VP is meant to be 'worse', but my experience with the 823 just gave me a lot of trust for the brand.

On the other hand, the dialog 3 looks stunning. Thanks, why would you say it is not worth it? I am also leaning towards the Pilot, but am curious. Haha, I can understand that, but for me, although I know I'm in the minority here, it's actually the other way around, the Curidas for me is rather decent looking, while I hate the aesthetics of the VP with a passion ;) Lol understand 100%.
Asetheics is very important if you are to use it everyday.
I like curidas bc i can see the mechanics inside and it's longer. I have decimos and it is too small for me. I have the Dialog 3 and it‚Äôs one of my favorite pens, the Lamy gold nib is outstanding and the lacquered body feels great, plus I really enjoy the mechanism that reveals the nib, it‚Äôs very satisfying. I‚Äôve tried the Pilot, it‚Äôs a great pen but a little underwhelming and I‚Äôm not a fan of the looks but that is purely subjective. I still feel that in terms of build quality, engineering and materials the Dialog is a step above from my point of view. On the pictures dialog looks good, but when you hold it on your hand it is just a chunky metal. 

Doesn‚Äôt seal as good as pilot. 

Doesn‚Äôt always come back to the same location when you twist. Imagine lines not aligning after you refill it, this type of stuff makes some people crazy, especially after paying $200+ for a pen. It was the raden, when i saw it in person, that converted me to the VP. I also used to hate it with a passion! Have you had issues with hard starts? I found several (though old) posts of people suggesting it dried out even when unused for a day or so. Thanks. I‚Äôll go for the Pilot! It depends on the ink you use but yes it‚Äôs more prone to drying out than a normal screw cap pen, I use it everyday and it‚Äôs not an issue but if you don‚Äôt use it for a few days you‚Äôll have some hard starts, when it happens I just twist the converter a bit, saturate the feed and nib, wipe it with a tissue and I‚Äôm good to go.";0;https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1j3x18c/if_price_is_the_same_lamy_dialog_3_vs_pilot/;fountainpens;"If price is the same: Lamy Dialog 3 vs Pilot Capless Vanishing Point I have recently been fascinated by capless fountain pens and am keen to add one to my collection as one of my two main pens to go alongside my Pilot Custom 823 F.

Pilot Vanishing Point cartridge options...;"I absolutely love the ease of use of the Pilot Vanishing Point pens, and it is by far my most favorite own over even the Pilot Custom 823. But anyone with a Pilot fountain pen knows the converters hold about 1 page worth of ink, so are hardly worth the hassle. Their disposable ink cartridges are convenient, and they've been releasing more colors here and there, but they are EXPENSIVE (for someone who just spent every last penny on the pen itself, lol).

While home, I've been refilling empty cartridges with the bottled Iroshizuku inks, but I can't really carry around a reused ink cartridge, with no cap. I tried using hot glue, thinking it would just pop off when ready to use,  but... no. Lol. Weirdly, I  bought these thin needle syringes to fill the  empty cartridges with,  and the caps that go over the needle PERFECTLY insert themselves into the open ends of the empty Pilot cartridges. Yay! However, it's large and, since it's not exactly made for that purpose, I'm afraid to carry a cartridge around in my planner or purse. 

Then I saw that Majohn offers empty a1 (their dupe for the Vanishing Point) cartridges and wondered... has anyone tried these in their Vanishing Point,  before I bother to order them internationally?";"The Pilot cartridges can be resealed using the little disc that seals them initially. Remove the disc, fill the cartridge, then place the disc over the opening and -carefully- apply even pressure to the disc with something just smaller than the opening (like a pencil eraser) till it sits down at the line where it was originally. Takes a little bit of practice so I recommend starting with water-filled carts before doing it for real with ink. But I do this all the time and have never had one fail, even with rough international travel. >But anyone with a Pilot fountain pen knows the converters hold about 1 page worth of ink, so are hardly worth the hassle.

That's just hyperbole, unless you're drawing all over an A3 page with stippling, cross-hatching, and layering over and over in various parts of the picture. What page size and in which style of handwriting are we talking about?

>I can't really carry around a reused ink cartridge, with no cap.

So put a cap on it. If you want something more secure than a glob of hot glue, these days 3-D printing is so common, I'm sure you can (if need be, get someone else to) whip up something with a suitable type of filament.

>has anyone tried these in their Vanishing Point,

Yes. The cartridges fit the Pilot Capless. I won't speak to how tight or secure the caps are, however, given how much effort I had to put in to ensure those very fully filled cartridges (in [this ‚Äòkit‚Äô](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1h7294z/one_example_of_a_beginners_kit_tagged_spoiler_to/), in the last image) didn't leak in transit by post. pardon me as i go on a small rant here but i honestly don't believe figuring out a con-40 is worse than all this. i just don't believe it. i know hundreds of people on here swear daily that they would rather do all this crap than ever touch a con-40, but... come on.

i have a pilot capless i've been using for weeks and it's still on the first con-40 fill i ever attemped. i've written far more than a page.

I actually AM using my pen that much. I have a daily journaling habit and write 10+ letter-size pages a day using either a medium, bold or stub nib... they use a lot of ink. I'm starting to feel like everyone is surprised that some people heavily use their fountain pens?

Are 3D printers things people randomly have in their homes these days? If so, they aren't any of the people I know. Lol It is because the people who hate con-40s don't know how to use them.  I have never had a problem with them, but maybe it is because I carry three pens.  But I check ink level every week or so.

All pens will fail you eventually.  So just blame the con-40. :; I write up to 10 letter size pages every single day, front and back. I'd have to fill a converter four times vs one cartridge. I'll take the cartridges.

Weird that my question and a tip on reusable cartridges gets downvoted. Thank you for answering the question! I just ordered some! I use a pair of tweezers but I‚Äôve seen people use a bent paper clip to hook it out as well Yup, you can certainly refill and reuse the cartridge without resealing it. It‚Äôs a little trickier to clean and refill with the disc in place but doesn‚Äôt affect use. You had mentioned carrying extras which is why I mentioned how to reseal them. I didn't say the pen is failing me? I said the converters don't hold enough ink for me. The pen functions beautifully.  I write 10+ letter size pages a day, front and back, with the only pen I own. I do have three nibs for the pen, a medium, bold, and stub... they all use a lot of ink. My journaling habit requires a few refills with a converter. Or just a single cartridge... that I can also refill, since I've found a way to cap. Ie... better than a converter that holds 1/3 of the ink. When you journal outside of the house almost daily, carrying a bottle of ink seems silly. you have to fill a converter after writing four sides of letter paper? i don't think that matches with my experience so i don't know what to say, you do what seems right for your situation. maybe one idea would be to possibly invest in a finer nib I'm definitely give that a try! That use case is different from the start of the post.   Maybe you should carry a small bottle of ink like a pilot 10mL bottle or better would be to find something plastic with a good sealing cap like a traveling ink well.   Recapped cartridges are not as reliable as you would like. That's why I was asking about the majohn cartridges, specifically designed to be refilled and carried.  

I did end up buying them since posting this, and they are perfect! No messy ink fills on the go, and no plastic waste of the disposable cartridges. I had one of those travel ink wells a while ago and hated it. Never managed to keep my fingers ink free lol.";0;https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1jbi1rd/pilot_vanishing_point_cartridge_options/;fountainpens;"Pilot Vanishing Point cartridge options... I absolutely love the ease of use of the Pilot Vanishing Point pens, and it is by far my most favorite own over even the Pilot Custom 823. But anyone with a Pilot fountain pen knows the converters hold about 1 page worth of ink, so are hardly worth the hassle. Their disposable ink cartridges are convenient, and they've been releasing more colors here and there, but they are EXPENSIVE (for someone who just spent every last penny on the pen itself, lol).

While home, I've been refilling empty cartridges with the bottled Iroshizuku inks, but I can't really carry around a reused ink cartridge, with no cap. I tried using hot glue, thinking it would just pop off when ready to use,  but... no. Lol. Weirdly, I  bought these thin needle syringes to fill the  empty cartridges with,  and the caps that go over the needle PERFECTLY insert themselves into the open ends of the empty Pilot cartridges. Yay! However, it's large and, since it's not exactly made for that purpose, I'm afraid to carry a cartridge around in my planner or purse. 

Then I saw that Majohn offers empty a1 (their dupe for the Vanishing Point) cartridges and wondered... has anyone tried these in their Vanishing Point,  before I bother to order them internationally? The Pilot cartridges can be resealed using the little disc that seals them initially. Remove the disc, fill the cartridge, then place the disc over the opening and -carefully- apply even pressure to the disc with something just smaller than the opening (like a pencil eraser) till it sits down at the line where it was originally. Takes a little bit of practice so I recommend starting with water-filled carts before doing it for real with ink. But I do this all the time and have never had one fail, even with rough international travel. >But anyone with a Pilot fountain pen knows the converters hold about 1 page worth of ink, so are hardly worth the hassle.

That's just hyperbole, unless you're drawing all over an A3 page with stippling, cross-hatching, and layering over and over in various parts of the picture. What page size and in which style of handwriting are we talking about?

>I can't really carry around a reused ink cartridge, with no cap.

So put a cap on it. If you want something more secure than a glob of hot glue, these days 3-D printing is so common, I'm sure you can (if need be, get someone else to) whip up something with a suitable type of filament.

>has anyone tried these in their Vanishing Point,

Yes. The cartridges fit the Pilot Capless. I won't speak to how tight or secure the caps are, however, given how much effort I had to put in to ensure those very fully filled cartridges (in [this ‚Äòkit‚Äô](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1h7294z/one_example_of_a_beginners_kit_tagged_spoiler_to/), in the last image) didn't leak in transit by post. pardon me as i go on a small rant here but i honestly don't believe figuring out a con-40 is worse than all this. i just don't believe it. i know hundreds of people on here swear daily that they would rather do all this crap than ever touch a con-40, but... come on.

i have a pilot capless i've been using for weeks and it's still on the first con-40 fill i ever attemped. i've written far more than a page.

I bought a secondhand Pilot Vanishing point. Was I scammed?;"Hi all,

I bought a Pilot Vanishing point in Matte black <F> a couple months ago. It's my first gold nib pen but it's not writing as beautifully as my kakuno. The written lines are even thicker than my Lamy Safari EF. I also noticed that the nib is blue instead of usual black. 

Did I get scammed? 

I'm really disappointed with the writing experience. I was expecting so much from it as all the reviews I've read was great. ";"Pic? There aren't any fake VPs, just very obvious copies with completely different brand logos (moonman or jinhao). 

You got an F, which is supposed to be thicker than an EF. I know people say Japanese runs thinner, but at below medium, they are pretty much around the same, so your VP F is expected to be a little wider. Plus it's an 18K nib, so it's softness should result in a wider line. You may just prefer a fine hard nail, for which I would actually recommend getting one of the Chinese copies since they are steel EFs that would run like your lamy ef. 

It's also possible the previous owner may have been a little abusive and opened the tines. 

Honestly, at the price point, I would recommend testing the pen before purchasing if possible. Probably not, but we really need to see photos of the pen and nib to have an opinion.  There may be something off or not functioning correctly‚Ä¶ Looks real to me OP Looks legit to me, I second the ""someone messed with it"" sentiment. I smoothed one myself and it writes thicker but it's also smoooooooth and juicy. Re: writing experience - Even when new, Capless/VP's nib writes very different than other Pilot Pens and tend to appear to write wider if you have a heavier hand in my experience. I find the nib very soft and flexible - closer to a pointed dib pen nib. I actually love how capless feels and the result it produces but it might be a shock if you weren't expecting it. Some of Pilot's other gold nib pens feels will feel a lot similar to kakuno, if you decide to trade it for something else.

If that's what you mean by disappointing writing experience, that probably proves it's the real pen. https://preview.redd.it/qh6jh0725dye1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=830ad3569bb5b94e5ec9cbd052cdd47a1654fa87

I use a fountain pen with a M point about half the time and the rest of the time I use a Pentel Energel or Uni-Signo 1.0mm tip and really don't feel much difference. JMHO. Now they make, lamy is now under uni, And the matte black instead of the silver endcap and tip. i did have to order online and import it from Japan. I'm not sure why but no stationery store in my country carry these models That's the standard clip for version 2 of the pen. The first version had a silver clip with a plastic blue gem on it. 

Uni Jetstream Prime 3 I got the 2+1 version. everything is great although I would prefer a blue over red refill. my only issue so far is that the original SXR-200 refills are a bit pricey! Size and form wise i prefer the jetstream 3 and 1 better. Only thing I would change about it is the blue jewel they put on the clip. Not a big fan of that i had to import it directly from Japan. its more than a year since this model is initially released but no retailer in my country has carried it yet Oh yeah they are. Try amazon japan and grt maybe 10-20pcs. It'll probably be worth the shipping if this is your primary pen. I ordered some zebra gel refills too but ive yet to swap them out. They most likely would fit(i hope?). If you want something more customizable do check out the sharbo x multipens. I love them.";;

Lamy 2000 or Pilot Vanishing Point?;I am looking to get my boyfriend a pen, roughly $150-$180 budget. He takes a bunch of notes every day for work so I want to get him something that can be a daily writer. I also want something that is feels smooth and is easy to replace the ink. The Lamy 2000 and the Pilot Vanishing Point both came up as options. What do you think is the better choice?;"Assuming you mean fountain pens, the Lamy 2000 is probably the better choice for a workhorse pen. It's a piston filler that carries more ink than the Vanishing Point does with either a cartridge or a converter.

The Vanishing Point is also a very nice pen, but considerably heavier, and as I said, holds less ink. Mine's nib has also always dried out too easily for my liking, while the 2000's nib has never dried out. Some people also dislike the placement of the clip, but I've never had a problem with that. Both great but I think the VP for its capless convenience. Unless you think he writes so much he'll use the ink in a day. Do you know what he'd prefer nib wise?

Favorite inks to use with capless/vanishing point?";"Unisex??

Good to know. Any thing iroshizuku... Check out r/fountainpens I'm curious to know why there is a ""unisex"" descriptor for a pen. I have a Capless Decimo. I would suggest, like the others did, the Pilot Iroshizuku line even tho I find it quite expensive. I'm currently using in mine Waterman Serenity Blue, looks great, flow is awsome and its not that expensive either. It's not necessary to use the same brand of ink. You can go with any brand, Noodlers is very popular in US.

You can check multiple inks along with swatches over [here](https://www.jetpens.com/Fountain-Pen-Inks/ct/3250) and [here](https://mountainofink.com/).

If you want to go with Iroshizuku, Kon Peki is the most loved and top rated. ‚Ä¶is the clip at the bottom? They're wonderful pens. I've had one for about 5 or 6 years now in a gun metal color. That yellow is beautiful. I'll also suggest the Iroshizuku inks. So many beautiful colors to choose from. I tried it and i regret it. Brought it back. The nib was scratchy, the flow was dry, and there was some rattling inside the pen. Chou kuro. It really is the best black. Pilot nibs are usually dry so I would reccomend wet inks ! Some wet inks are most of pilot iroshizuku line , diamine , waterman...... Would be more than happy to help you more too This post cracked me up so much. Thanks u/Tangy94.

'Accidentally' in quotes is just another word for 'Deliberately' ?ü§£ Unisex pen is hilarious! Wonderful accidents! Oopsie Pilot cartridges are good, if you use a converter suggest Parker or Pelikan bottle .  nI use a vanishing point fine point  and am very happy wi0th it.  I own 10 in all This is Very cool - never seen one like this - no chance of a leaky tip ruining my shirt! that thing says I'm broke i think you can cancel the order still The scientists at Pilot thought they were safe. But life...life finds a way... ?üòÇ?üòÇ Yeah‚Ä¶Kokuyo describes their Soofa style notebook as being ‚Äúfor women.‚Äù I guess there‚Äôs a bit of gender inequality going on in the stationery makers in Japan. I was actually looking at that brand! Thank you :) Lmao no idea You guys don‚Äôt put your pens up‚Ä¶oh‚Ä¶oh no. I‚Äôve been using them wrong this whole time‚Ä¶ Waterman is definitely a good option! I want to get a small amount of iroshizuku to try for sure. Ah yes, i know! I have an artisan bottled ink and some cartridges currently for other pens. But i was just curious if others use certain inks with vanishing points since they dont have a cap.

Edit: i do want to try iroshizuku! Yea so of you clip it to yourself the ink doesnt drip out on you :) I was going for the gunmetal at first but then fell in love with the yellow :)

Im definitely going to be tryint iroshizuku! Maybe a dud, perhaps a poor nib choice. I've had mine for over ten years and it's been fantastic. Also agreed it may have been a dud! That absolutely sucks, im sorry.

I do see complaints about dryness! But people are suggesting watery inks to help with that. 

Also in the advertising, it says that every time you want to write again after a pause to tap it down before extending the nib. Thank you! Thank you so much! I know people have a hard time with thr dryness. Im planning on some iroshizuku. Ive never looked into diamine but i see its popular! I believe i may have some waterman blue ink.

I just need to get a converter for this. Not sure if i should get the con-20, 40, or 50. 50 is enticing because it can carry 0.7ml instead of standard 0.4. I saw reviews that the 50 is more prone to leaking though. 

Im also going to test this pen out with some cartridges so i have some time to cherry pick stuff. No problem ?üòÇ

It was accidentally deliberate! I know right? ?üòÇ Thank you!! Ive had my eye on a vanishing point for years and i figured out the vanishing point is the US version of the Japanese Capless (for the most part). And its cheaper than buying a vanishing point. Lol i dont want to cancel. I was being sarcastic when i said accidentally :) The new one- Irushizuki To-Ro, gorgeous color and readable. I‚Äôm uncertain of what its assigned gender is‚Ä¶ ?üòÅ In that case, you could go with any of the following 

1) Kon Peki 
2) Yama Budo
3) Asa Gao
4) Shin Ryoku
5) Shin Kai
6) Take Sumi

Or if you want to match your pen 

7) To Ro Makes sense! This is an interesting pen, I imagine the clip being on the grip would bug me but let us know when you get it! Looking for a good fountain alternative for work, I currently just use the Zebra zensations disposable ones for work to avoid bringing anything too nice Mine was a birthday present several years ago. The yu-yake color is my go to. It's a great reddish orange color. It stays in my Lamy pen. Tsuki-yo is a tealish blue that is usually in my Pilot. I am 99% sure that all the vanishing points come with a con-40 converter ! That's how mine came and many others.....

Depending on the nib size the 0.4ml could be enough for you... I got an EF nib size and I can't really complain about the ink volume inside the pen.. Cartridges is also a great way to have max ink capacity ! You have fun with it haha

Would love to take a peak in your whole fountain pen collection... >It was accidentally deliberate!

That's my go to excuse now for all the pens I buy haha. ?üòÇ?üòÇ?üòÇ I just got this color with my deep yellow Pilot Prera. It's beautiful Thank you for reading my mind and giving me an ink that matches the pen lol its the first thing i thought of after buying it.

I will definitely look into these and also which converter to get. Ive read it does bug some people. I will definitely give a little review once i get it :) Those sound lovely! In this listing it says ""converter sold separately"" unfortunately :(

Im going to do cartridges until i get the ink situation put together! 1ml is pretty nice to start with lol i got the F nib on this one so shouldnt be far off from your EF.

I'll definitely do a post of my collection this weekend! Yesss ?üòÇ I‚Äôm very tempted, but I did a big pen and ink haul last month, so I‚Äôm trying to wait a while. Happy to help! ?üòÅ";83;https://i.redd.it/9hbhpjkztm2f1.jpeg;pens;"Uhhh. Oops! ""Accidentally"" hit the place order button lol

Are there any affordable clickable fountain pens. The vanishing point is $156 too expensive for me.;Eventually one day I will get it right I like the 2015 limited edition twilight. But I like to buy new pens and not used. Anyway are there any cheap ones for like $25-30. That I can use now get practice and experience with for now. I have the metropolitan my first fountain pen and its solid.;"If you can stretch the budget to 40$ *maybe* you can find a second hand Platinum Curidas for that price. I'd save for the real deal though, if you spend 30$ now instead of saving money for the Pilot VP, you're still 156$ away from your goal with a pen you don't really like as much. The same reasoning applies to those shitty Curidas clones you can find on aliexpress. The Pilot Mr (or Metropolitan) is a superb workhorse pen, you can keep using it until you reach 156$ saved. I think lanbitou made a curidas knockoff in that price range. The reviews I've seen speak to it not really being worth it. I mean it works, but the seal isn't good  etc. You'll get a clickable fountainpen if you really want to try, but honestly I doubt it is durable... So I'd save for a used platinum curidas too. I own 2 Curidases for quick color changes when taking color coded notes. They are functional and work most of the time but it's not completely fool-proof. I for instance would not recommend them to a beginner. One of my Curidases is starting to give me problems everytime I reinsert a just-inked cartridge into the barrel even though I follow the instructions and make sure that the notches and stuff are all aligned (I've only used it for about 2-3 months). I'm still trying to figure this issue out and come up with a fix. Nevertheless I enjoy writing with them because I enjoy using Platinum's steel nibs. I say save your money for a new VP and buy it at a store where you are allowed to test the nib. If you buy it but end up not liking it after a few months, there's always r/pen_swap and it seems like there's usually some demand for a used VP.

Something that got stuff done. Patina is  where it‚Äôs at. It's great to see a tool that's such a central part of your everyday life. I remember a couple years back when I cracked my beautiful Mont Blanc cover. (Stopped using it on an everyday basis) Patina!

War wounds.

I saw someone intentionally introduce wear to his PILOT VP and it looks cool. To me, it's just a pen. Use it to write with and that's it. Nothing special Nah, I try and keep my VPs sorta nice since they're my favorite pens. I'm not neurotic about it, just kinda OCD about all my stuff in general since I'm a minimalist, and a maximalist when it comes to getting my money's worth lol

That's some nice brassing though. They'd probably appreciate it in r/wellworn. I have a Montegrappa Copper Mule I got around the pandemic.  Not sure if it's from hand sanitizer or just general wear, but the matte finish on the silver trim wore off within the first year. It was annoying at first, but damned if it doesn't make it one of my favorites now that I can just chuck it into my bag.  

I have a matte Vanishing Point, but unfortunately I got it in EF, so yeah, it's kinda pristine. Lol i beat the shit out of my VP one of the few expensive pends i edc and abuse. Well worn is well loved ?üíú They are meant to be used. I try to take care of my pens, but have never used a pen case. This is actually beautiful One thing pens have taught me is that expensive is in the eye of the beholder and the most important rule is to enjoy your pens. Seems like you‚Äôre abiding by the most important rule. I have a cheap Chinese Xinhao that my coworkers (who don‚Äôt know any better) compliment all the time. I beat the hell outta that thing. I regularly carry my Twsbi vac 700 and diamond 580ALR, and my Lamy Studio.

Take it anywhere I travel and use it as it is meant to be used. I may be a stylophile, but I'm a lucky one, because I've never forgotten what my parents told me when we found out I had a thing for pens clear back in 5th grade: it's always fine to love a tool, admire how it's made and how it looks, evaluate and appreciate how well it works, and feel happiest when you are using it instead of another tool of its kind, but never, ever forget it's a tool, or that a tool's purpose is to be used, not just placed on a shelf and admired. 

Yes, that's a nice pen, and yes, they look really nice when they come out of the box, but a well-used, well-loved pen shouldn't look like it's brand-spankin' new‚Äîit should look like it's getting a lot of regular use because that's the best possible testament to a pen being a quality writing instrument.

This is the dream. love the vanishing point. i‚Äôm an illustrator and i love when tools look used. I love it! Love the imperfections and the signs of use - wabi sabi! I thought that was my pen for a second, I loved a lived pen ?üò? It tells its story, that it is used and loved. Totally agree with you I have had my vanishing point since 2017 used nearly every day and it‚Äôs great! I spent that much money on a pen so I could use it for a long time and be kinda hard on it. Not just a collection piece. Use your things! Or else you will be on your deathbed surrounded by things that no longer matter to you. Your pen matters to you today so use the shit out of it I have a $20 Smootherpro that people seem to think is a $100 pen the way they treat it on the rare occasion that I let someone use it to sign paperwork. It is brass and heavy, and I used a blackening solution on it that has worn down to 40% coverage. It has been dropped on concrete a couple of times. I  think at this point I have spent more looking for the refill I like than the pen. It just isn't a bic. I pocket carry my Caran d'Ache Varius Ivanhoe somewhat regularly. It's got a nice clip on it. I honestly think your pen looks better than my new and pristine one. Nice to see that it gets such a nice ""patina"", something to aspire to for me :) Its actually in decent condition man, for a pen, that‚Äôs completely fine I love it.

Sheaffer Award Rollerball in Matte Green (currently my favourite pen that I actually own)

S.T. Dupont Liberate Fountain, Black

2. Retro 51 Tornado ""The System"" alloy. As they say, life is too short for a boring pen.

3. A sharpie fine point.

4. Pilot decimo. I have two of the 20 colors pens, and which one I'd pick on any given day is probably a coin toss, but the purple one might edge the turquoise on out today. The nib would be the same either way. F nib that came with my raden VP, because I just like that one the best, in spite of it not matching the trim on any of them.

5. Sailor PGS Northern Lights. EF, because that's what's on the one I have, but in an ideal world it'd have an F on it. - Scriptorium custom with a Masuyama broad italic¬†

Super comfy and decent ink/writing experience. My list as it currently stands as of 1/18/2025 but subject to change at any given moment:

If it took Parker style refills and wasn‚Äôt so back heavy it would be in my top 5 My Mont Blanc ballpoint is the softest and smoothest pen I have ever written with. No joke the refill is absolutely phenomenal and the way it writes is one of a kind dare I say it‚Äôs the best pen I have r ever written with period. I wrote with a dipped FP at a pen shop and didn‚Äôt like it as much because I felt it was scratchy. With that said, I know Mont Blancs can be crazy expensive. For a fraction of the cost (though still pretty expensive) you could always grab a bigideadesign Ti Arto and through it in there. Imo it‚Äôs totally worth it, but just for the record, while I do feel it‚Äôs the best, there are still some great 12 pack options like uni jetstream, Schmidt easy flow, pilot acroball and Parker quinkflow just to name a few. The closest ink to the mb that I feel I have tried is the Visconti smart ouch which is a Parker g2 refill just so you know ?üëç?üèº I love it haha! Go with the flow ?üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Same! Thanks.

4. Pilot decimo. I have two of the 20 colors pens, and which one I'd pick on any given day is probably a coin toss, but the purple one might edge the turquoise on out today.

Pilot Vanishing Point Ballpoint Pen: Where to find blue-black ink refill?;"My father-in-law loves this pen and if possible for Christmas I'd like to find the pen refills for him.

Paper and Grace.

You walk in and there is a 10ft case of beautiful top of the line pens. Pilot, Kawco, Schaeffer, etc. The rest of the store is filled with an absolute ton of mid to high-end inks/refills, a ton of our favorite cheaper pens, mechanical pencils, regular and colored pencils, notebooks, wax stampint supplies, desk organizers, and other imported Japanese and European items.

I will absolutely be going back soon!

I REALLY wanted a Pilot Vanishing Point but i couldnt spend that much haha so i got this OHTO Japan GS02 in khaki. Sooo lovely to hold! Writes beautifully!";"Really underrated. Maybe my favorite EDC pen right now. Cool pen, congrats! How long is that? Great choice! I got the exact same about 2 months ago and have really enjoyed it. Also one of the few in my collection my partner likes (he isn‚Äôt into pens and most of mine are too lightweight for him). I too just discovered it a shop near me, loving it so far! Great color choice mines a bit darker green Must be a new store? Is it downtown? I moved out of Bozeman in 2020 after I finished up playing for the Bobcats in 2019 and don't remember it ever being a thing out there. I literally tried every cheaper pen they had (maybe 20?) and this one came out on top. I love it! Hmm. Maybe 5.5 inches? I can measure it when i get home though :) Im glad!! That's awesome. Ah nice!! They had either this color or black and this one came out on top lol It says their bozeman location placed in the top 10 stationary shops in the US in 2019. But im not sure what year they opened.

Edit: they are on E Oak St. Im not super familiar with Bozeman though! Not sure if thats up or downtown. Nuts, that'd be similar to an F-301. I'm keen on giving OHTO a whirl. Duuude/ette I got the black one first, came back for the green spare a week later. Don‚Äôt wanna lose it, it is my go to pen now. Definitely similar! Its also a very nice finish. I like it more than the F-301. Feels like a powder coated or textured and painted metal. Nice weight as well :) spent $15 so very cheap for a nicely built pen.

I appreciate your organization. It‚Äôs super helpful!! ?üòä thank you! Having a cheap gel pen list without Pen + Gear gel pens on the list @ .33 per, nor the Office Hub gel pen @ .50 per... kind of a weird situation going on there. Pilot vanishing point Not a single Rotring? Come on, son. Some observations:

1. The ballpoint and gel inks both are populated by thin tips. You might consider adding the Jetstream 0.7mm, Acroball 1.0mm, and Energel 0.7mm unless you‚Äôre specifically looking for fine tipped pens.

2. Surprised that EasyFlow 9000 didn‚Äôt make the ballpoint list. It‚Äôs generally highly thought of here.

3. If you‚Äôre going to get into fountain pens, you need to think about the ink. A great nib can certainly underperform with a crappy ink. I'm not sure what your goal for this list is but I hope you aren't getting everything on all these lists all at once. Either way, here are a few things to consider.

For your ballpoint list, the Zebra F-701 doesn't actually write that well. It just has a nice metal body. I recommend skipping it and first find a ballpoint based on performance and then maybe find a body that you like where you can replace the refill. The Power tank and the Fisher are in that ""write anywhere and on anything, even upside down"" category that doesn't really compare to the other ballpoints. They don't write particularly well but are good to have if you find yourself in that kind of situation. I would only get one if you actually need it but definitely not the $30 version. There are cheaper versions of the Fisher since they use the same refill and you are paying a premium just for the body. The Cap-0-Matic is a good version that can be found for around $15. 

For your gel pens keep in mind that some models like the Zebra Sarasa and Pentel Energel have different versions. For instance the Zebra Sarasa has the R, Dry, Mark On, Clip, Nano and a few more. Some models use the same refills and just have different bodies. Others have different refills or only have certain colors and tip sizes available in those models.

For your Fountain pen list, I recommend removing some based on the fact that they are too similar. For instance in the Platinum line the Preppy, Profounte, and the Plaisar all use the same nib section and just have a different body. Get the Preppy because it's the cheapest and it will suffice if you are just testing performance. In the Pilot line the Kakuno, Metropolitan, Explorer, Prera (Not on list), Penmanship (Not on list) all have interchangeable nibs which make them all the same. Get the Kakuno because it's the cheapest and has a whimsical face on it. Some of the Chinese brands like the Jinhao Shark suffer from quality control. It's not uncommon to buy 5 of them and have 1 or 2 not work right. If at all possible get them from the cheapest place available, which unfortunately is probably going to be AliExpress. DO NOT BUY A FOUNTAIN PEN OVER $35. If all you are doing is trying to test them out, skip the expensive ones for now. The Lamy Vista, Safari (Didn't see on the list), and the Al-Star all use the same nib, get the cheapest one and remove the rest. And I believe the Muji only comes in Medium.

As for overall advice, don't get some pens based on the outside and don't get some pens based on what's on the inside. For example the rOtring 600(or 800, Rapid Pro), and Parker Jotter, are some great pens from the outside but are in a category of pens that offer many different ""standard"" refills. A rOtring with a substandard refill will not outperform a Jotter with a great refill despite the price. Testing those kinds of refills would be its own separate list. The Zebra F-701 is a great pen that suffers from a mediocre refill and finding a different one that fits it is tiresome. If you are looking into metal pens, that would be its own list. Getting a metal body that fits your favorite refill is great but not necessary if you are just testing.

Fountain pens can be a bit of a rabbit hole with many different caveats. Fountain pens can be and usually are a very personal item. There are so many things to consider for fountain pens that testing them out can be difficult. Opinions and preferences play a huge part in fountain pens. A hefty fountain pen might feel like a premium to some but not to others. A large ink capacity might be great if you write for hours a day but not great for those that like to try different inks often. Some people really like smooth fountain pens, while others like a bit of ""feedback"", and both hate scratchy nibs. How you hold your pen might make one work better for you and another a pain. Do you have large hands and prefer thicker pens or small hands and prefer thinner pens? Are you going to daily carry it and need one that can be abused a bit or not have to worry about losing? Or are you going to get one based on the craftsmanship that will not leave the house due to the price tag? Are you very particular on how a pen looks? Do you like the classic cigar shaped black pen because it is timeless or do you want one that glows in the dark, and is decked out in sparkles? One is not inherently better than the other. Also, fountain pens suffer from a very clear ""diminishing returns"" curve, more so than other pens. The $300 fountain is not going to write 10X better than a $30 pen. That $500 fountain pen might not write perfectly to your liking but might be perfect for someone else. That $75 fountain pen might dry out in 2 weeks if not used, while that $6 Preppy might go 6 months with no issues. 

Paper. Paper can be just as important as everything else. What kind of paper you use can affect how a pen writes, feels, and how fast it dries. Are you going to be writing on cheap office paper, or in a journal? Some good brands are Clairefontaine, Rhodia, Tomoe River, Midori, and Mnemosyne. So better suited for fountain pens and others for journaling. Rhodia is a nice middle ground.

Good luck with your endeavors. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

I appreciate your organization. It‚Äôs super helpful!! ?üòä thank you! Having a cheap gel pen list without Pen + Gear gel pens on the list @ .33 per, nor the Office Hub gel pen @ .50 per... kind of a weird situation going on there. Pilot vanishing point Not a single Rotring? Come on, son. Some observations:

1. The ballpoint and gel inks both are populated by thin tips. You might consider adding the Jetstream 0.7mm, Acroball 1.0mm, and Energel 0.7mm unless you‚Äôre specifically looking for fine tipped pens.

2. Surprised that EasyFlow 9000 didn‚Äôt make the ballpoint list. It‚Äôs generally highly thought of here.

3. If you‚Äôre going to get into fountain pens, you need to think about the ink. A great nib can certainly underperform with a crappy ink. I'm not sure what your goal for this list is but I hope you aren't getting everything on all these lists all at once. Either way, here are a few things to consider.

For your ballpoint list, the Zebra F-701 doesn't actually write that well. It just has a nice metal body. I recommend skipping it and first find a ballpoint based on performance and then maybe find a body that you like where you can replace the refill. The Power tank and the Fisher are in that ""write anywhere and on anything, even upside down"" category that doesn't really compare to the other ballpoints. They don't write particularly well but are good to have if you find yourself in that kind of situation. I would only get one if you actually need it but definitely not the $30 version. There are cheaper versions of the Fisher since they use the same refill and you are paying a premium just for the body. The Cap-0-Matic is a good version that can be found for around $15. 

For your gel pens keep in mind that some models like the Zebra Sarasa and Pentel Energel have different versions. For instance the Zebra Sarasa has the R, Dry, Mark On, Clip, Nano and a few more. Some models use the same refills and just have different bodies. Others have different refills or only have certain colors and tip sizes available in those models.

For your Fountain pen list, I recommend removing some based on the fact that they are too similar. For instance in the Platinum line the Preppy, Profounte, and the Plaisar all use the same nib section and just have a different body. Get the Preppy because it's the cheapest and it will suffice if you are just testing performance. In the Pilot line the Kakuno, Metropolitan, Explorer, Prera (Not on list), Penmanship (Not on list) all have interchangeable nibs which make them all the same. Get the Kakuno because it's the cheapest and has a whimsical face on it. Some of the Chinese brands like the Jinhao Shark suffer from quality control. It's not uncommon to buy 5 of them and have 1 or 2 not work right. If at all possible get them from the cheapest place available, which unfortunately is probably going to be AliExpress. DO NOT BUY A FOUNTAIN PEN OVER $35. If all you are doing is trying to test them out, skip the expensive ones for now. The Lamy Vista, Safari (Didn't see on the list), and the Al-Star all use the same nib, get the cheapest one and remove the rest. And I believe the Muji only comes in Medium.

As for overall advice, don't get some pens based on the outside and don't get some pens based on what's on the inside. For example the rOtring 600(or 800, Rapid Pro), and Parker Jotter, are some great pens from the outside but are in a category of pens that offer many different ""standard"" refills. A rOtring with a substandard refill will not outperform a Jotter with a great refill despite the price. Testing those kinds of refills would be its own separate list. The Zebra F-701 is a great pen that suffers from a mediocre refill and finding a different one that fits it is tiresome. If you are looking into metal pens, that would be its own list. Getting a metal body that fits your favorite refill is great but not necessary if you are just testing.

Fountain pens can be a bit of a rabbit hole with many different caveats. Fountain pens can be and usually are a very personal item. There are so many things to consider for fountain pens that testing them out can be difficult. Opinions and preferences play a huge part in fountain pens. A hefty fountain pen might feel like a premium to some but not to others. A large ink capacity might be great if you write for hours a day but not great for those that like to try different inks often. Some people really like smooth fountain pens, while others like a bit of ""feedback"", and both hate scratchy nibs. How you hold your pen might make one work better for you and another a pain. Do you have large hands and prefer thicker pens or small hands and prefer thinner pens? Are you going to daily carry it and need one that can be abused a bit or not have to worry about losing? Or are you going to get one based on the craftsmanship that will not leave the house due to the price tag? Are you very particular on how a pen looks? Do you like the classic cigar shaped black pen because it is timeless or do you want one that glows in the dark, and is decked out in sparkles? One is not inherently better than the other. Also, fountain pens suffer from a very clear ""diminishing returns"" curve, more so than other pens. The $300 fountain is not going to write 10X better than a $30 pen. That $500 fountain pen might not write perfectly to your liking but might be perfect for someone else. That $75 fountain pen might dry out in 2 weeks if not used, while that $6 Preppy might go 6 months with no issues. 

Paper. Paper can be just as important as everything else. What kind of paper you use can affect how a pen writes, feels, and how fast it dries. Are you going to be writing on cheap office paper, or in a journal? Some good brands are Clairefontaine, Rhodia, Tomoe River, Midori, and Mnemosyne. So better suited for fountain pens and others for journaling. Rhodia is a nice middle ground.

Good luck with your endeavors. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Quality difference of capped/capless rollerball refills?;"Anyone have a lot of experience with the variations on rollerball formulas? I'm passively trying to find the perfect refill.

I use a lot of Schmidt Capless ones because I like click pens, but I was wondering if I'm missing out.

From a design perspective, rollerballs seem to have the hardest time since they deal in water inks and ceramic ball application of that ink. Too wet and it leaks/spills/feathers, too dry and its effectively a worse ballpoint with skips/hard starts/drying out.

If one were able to use any refill and only cared about writing, are the standard (capped) euro/asian refill rollerballs qualitatively better? Does the reformulation of capless designs sacrifice some of that quality for versatility/shelf life such that, like, a Pilot Vanishing Point but for rollerballs would be needed?";"Not really. They all feel a bit different. None is significantly better than others. 

You can get a capped rollerball that fits full-size euro-type rollerball for a low price. Give it a go. 

A capped rollerball pen can accommodate a fineliner refill like the Schmidt 6040. 

Schmidt p8126, p8127 & p8120 are likely my favorite refills.

How much to send with a friend shopping in Japan?;"One of my coworkers who enjoys pens like I do is visiting Japan and asked if I wanted her to pick anything up for me. The answer is of course. But what?

Uni Jetstream prime twist One option: go over to r/machinedpens and find a great machined pen body to put refills into. 

Another option, just buy the Parker and replace the refill inside with something like the Ohto Flash Dry, which is a 0.5mm needlepoint refill (or another finer refill). You don't have to use the refill a pen comes with. Retractable Fountain Pen!

My favorite multi pen is the Pilot Hi-Tec-C Coleto, though I hate how fast I run through the refills. I just got the Zebra Blen and I like it, though the 0.7mm is a tad too thick for my handwriting. Overall, these are good pens. Thank you! They're definitely good pens ?üôå?üèæ?üôå?üèæ?üôå?üèæ It is expensive but I think it's worth it. Besides, I'm a fountain pen fan and I have pens that cost more than the VP. The Vanishing Point is pretty much my everyday carry. It's perma-inked with De Atramentis Archive ink. Could've guessed the VP would be at the top ?üòÇ that pen is remarkably well-loved by all who own one.

I've always thought, how well does it seal the nib? How long have you left it without using it, and does it write flawlessly as soon as you put nib to paper after, say, half a year of sitting in the drawer?

Also does it ever spit ink when clicking and unclicking? What about if it gets a bit of a shake when the nib is retracted?

I'm seriously considering a VP but I think I'll have to go and try one at a pen shop or a show. I need to see if it would be comfortable for me. I gotta get a One P now So far mine writes perfectly and seals well, too. I've never left a pen unused for more than a week. I feel like most fountains pens would struggle to start if they've been capped and put away for more than 2 weeks. And no, it doesn't spit out ink. I had a purple decimo in medium that did, but I returned it because the nib was also skipping.

I would suggest you try one because the position of the clip may not be comfortable for you. I have one and it's never leaked ink except one time when I accidentally opened it up inside it's case (pressed the button pushing it into my bag). 

It's the only pen I own that is more expensive than a lamy al-star or twsbi eco so I'm generally pretty careful with it. But the time it got loose in my bag for a week it was fine. 

Writes well immediately every time, unless it's running out of ink. And doesn't dry up any faster than my other pens. 

So - don't jam it into something button down and you should be fine. 

It's a really nice everyday pen. 

It feels like a luxurious pen to use, making it a nice little thing to make the day a tiny bit better, but it isn't flashy. Non pen people don't notice it, so it doesn't seem pretentious to use for work. (Not an issue for everyone but I work somewhere that does kind of matter). And it's practical because it really is good when you want to write briefly but frequently, which isn't where fountain pens shine. It's good for work, for note taking and studying etc as well as actually sitting down to write. 

I'd just like a second one so I could have plain black ink in one, and something fun in the other. It was a treat for myself the only time I ever got a tax refund (I'm in the UK and that shouldn't normally happen, not sure what went wrong) and I never regretted it. 

But definitely best to get your hands on one before buying if you can, pens are so subjective. Get it if you don't already have a Uni-ball One or if you want a pocket pen. Really, the larger pen uses the same ink. It will also be cheaper--the P cost me $6.50 whereas the regular one is under $2 on JetPens. Thank you for the reply!

There was a time I left about 4 pens inked and capped for most of a year (I wasn't doing very well and strayed away from journalling.)

The Jinhao X450, X750 and the Noodler's Ahab had to be disassembled and soaked in warm water overnight, then washed out the next day. My TWSBI Diamond 580 on the other hand wrote immediately with zero issues.

Pilot Timeline 
Bic Atlantis Ultra Comfort 
Lamy 2000 Ballpoint
Cap-O-Matic Fisher Space Pen";"I have never seen a timeline in the wild - what is your opinion of it? I like that it looks like an E95S The Bic Atlantis is so underrated - that grip is so squishy! nice haul so far.  I have pilot custom 823 and sailor 1911 and many more.  I like them both but I barely use them since I don't want to mess em up.  haha.  So, I find myself using some cheaper FP like TWSBI. I'd look into a fineliner in a rollerball pen body or a hybrid ballpoint. 

I prefer Pilot Fountain Pens over Sailor. I like the smoothness of the Pilot nibs over the feedback of the Sailor. I‚Äôd recommend a Pilot Custom 823 over a Sailor. And this is coming from someone who has hundreds of fountain pens and thousands worth of each brand. ?üëç Lol, the r/fountainpens rabbit hole.

I like Pilots better than Sailors, but Sailors come in a lot more colors and once you get used to that feedback, you'll like the brand a lot better. But Sailors aren't as good a value for the cost vs the similarly priced Pilot. IMO. At least once you get up to or past the 823/743. Diplomat Magnum. Affordable, snap cap, durable ABS body, and the best bouncey nib you can get under 100 bucks. Basically, everything I wanted from a Lamy Safari without the Overly aggressive triangle grip and with a lovely spring to the nib. One of the only pens I have that performs well with shimmer inks... or at least am willing to put shimmer inks in. I have a couple of timeline pens also.  The fun thing about them is you get to do a double twist to open the pen.  The first twist gets the cone shaped part out.  Then 2nd twist the pen tip comes out.  Kind of fun to play with.  :) It‚Äôs very good. Awesome feeling tapered diameter. The double-twist system to retract the pen is so classy. It looks modern to me even though there‚Äôs a similar Ageless(?) model from the 90‚Äôs. It also writes smoothly with the included cartridge. I catch myself staring at the resin body, the white shine reminds me of a pearl. I like it a lot. Recommended. Yup. It's centered for a reason. It may be my favorite. Definitely my most used pen. Right. I probably won't use it as a daily writer because I prefer ballpoint pens, but I can't deny the feeling of a good fountain pen every now and again. From what I've been able to find the Timeline and Ageless are the same. I don't own both pens so there might be differences I'm not aware of. 

There is Timeline Past with a wood grip and Timeline Future has a metal sleeve that wraps around the mostly plastic grip. Ah, I see.  I have collected a lot of FP.

My first FP, purchased more than 20 years ago, was a Vanishing Point.  Last year I pulled the trigger on the Water Surface, my favorite of the Vanishing Point Raden pens.  Lovely smooth writer and a beauty, but I simply don't reach for it often, and I don't keep pens that I don't use.  Comes in original box.  I am selling this with both the original <M> nib and a contemporaneously purchased 1.1 Stub.  I will include a CON-40 converter.~~  **~~$500~~** **SOLD**

Nib:  Bold Cursive Italic, Fine, or Medium.  I purchased the 02 at the 2024 Dallas Pen Show with a Broad Cursive Italic Nib.  I subsequently purchased steel FC <F> and <M> nibs.  I am not a fan of the small curve at the bottom of the pen's grip section, and regret not purchasing a FC model with a straight grip section.  If you have shopped FC pens, you know that FC only sells Nagahara CI nibs with pen purchases.  So, if you want to buy the pen with the BCI nib, the price is~~ **~~$150~~**~~.  If you want to buy the pen with the F or M nib, the price is~~ **~~$125~~**~~.  I will sell the other nibs that the pen buyer does not choose.~~  **~~$15~~** ~~for the F and M nibs,~~ **~~$30~~** ~~for the BCI nib.  Buyer of the pen gets priority choice, so I will not sell nibs individually until I sell the pen.

While the cap band has a few micro-scratches, this pen is in outstanding condition.  The characteristically soft CS gold nib has some semi-flex, but it can be difficult to distinguish because of the B nib and the wet ink flow.  **$175**

The date code on this one is puzzling--likely manufactured in 1945.  Third-generation Speedline filler with plastic plunger.  Length - 5-1/8"".  I have installed a new diaphragm.  I rate barrel translucence as fair--a bright light will shine through the barrel, but the translucence is not pristine.  The nib is neither bouncy nor stiff.  Very smooth writer, but micro-scratches (obvious under magnification) make this a user-grade pen.  A solid introduction to Vacumatics.  **$80**

To minimize back and forth messages, if you want to purchase a pen and do not have questions, please include your PayPal email in your initial message.

**~~Pilot Vanishing Point Water Surface -- M and 1.1  Stub.~~**¬†¬†~~Verification pics~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/a/vanishing-point-water-surface-24PqMYb)~~.¬† Condition: Conservatively rating as N since I've used it more times than I think qualify for an A2.  My first FP, purchased more than 20 years ago, was a Vanishing Point.  Last year I pulled the trigger on the Water Surface, my favorite of the Vanishing Point Raden pens.  Lovely smooth writer and a beauty, but I simply don't reach for it often, and I don't keep pens that I don't use.  Comes in original box.  I am selling this with both the original <M> nib and a contemporaneously purchased 1.1 Stub.  I will include a CON-40 converter.~~  **~~$500~~** **SOLD**

**~~Franklin-Christoph 02--BCI / F / M.~~**¬† ~~Verification pics~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/a/franklin-christoph-02-nibs-uNZq4XG)~~.¬† Condition: A2.  Color: Vintage Green.  Nib:  Bold Cursive Italic, Fine, or Medium.  I purchased the 02 at the 2024 Dallas Pen Show with a Broad Cursive Italic Nib.  I subsequently purchased steel FC <F> and <M> nibs.  I am not a fan of the small curve at the bottom of the pen's grip section, and regret not purchasing a FC model with a straight grip section.  If you have shopped FC pens, you know that FC only sells Nagahara CI nibs with pen purchases.  So, if you want to buy the pen with the BCI nib, the price is~~ **~~$150~~**~~.  If you want to buy the pen with the F or M nib, the price is~~ **~~$125~~**~~.  I will sell the other nibs that the pen buyer does not choose.~~  **~~$15~~** ~~for the F and M nibs,~~ **~~$30~~** ~~for the BCI nib.  Buyer of the pen gets priority choice, so I will not sell nibs individually until I sell the pen.   Comes in original box with FC pen sleeve and ink cartridges (and BCI Chop if you buy it with the BCI nib).~~  **Pen and all nibs SOLD.**

**Conway Stewart 27- B.**¬†¬†Verification pics¬†[here](https://imgur.com/a/conway-stewart-27-y8mKiza).¬† Condition: D for vintage.  Lever filler‚ÄîI have installed a new sac.¬† Beautiful pen in Cracked Ice, one of the more collectible CS colorways.  Very smooth, VERY wet writer.  WET. **W. E. T**.  Clear barrel imprints.  While the cap band has a few micro-scratches, this pen is in outstanding condition.  The characteristically soft CS gold nib has some semi-flex, but it can be difficult to distinguish because of the B nib and the wet ink flow.  **$175**

**Parker Vacumatic Major 3rd Gen - M.**  Verification pics¬†[here](https://imgur.com/a/parker-vacumatic-major-3rd-gen-WNXjUrN).¬† Condition: D for vintage.¬† Silver pearl stacked celluloid.  The date code on this one is puzzling--likely manufactured in 1945.  Third-generation Speedline filler with plastic plunger.  Length - 5-1/8"".  I have installed a new diaphragm.  I rate barrel translucence as fair--a bright light will shine through the barrel, but the translucence is not pristine.  The nib is neither bouncy nor stiff.  Very smooth writer, but micro-scratches (obvious under magnification) make this a user-grade pen.  A solid introduction to Vacumatics.  **$80**

**~~Pilot Metal Falcon - Brown - SF.~~**¬† ~~Verification pics~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/a/pilot-metal-falcon-iGFHbNs)~~. ¬†Condition: A2 (inked only a few times).¬† I prefer vintage semi-flex nibs.¬† Comes in original box (box is marked as a M nib, but it is SF per verification pics).¬† Pilot Con-70 converter included.~~¬†**~~$125~~** ~~because I've listed it previously (to no avail) and I want to be rid of it~~.  **SOLD**

**~~Platinum 3776 Century - Chartres Blue - ""M""~~**~~.  Verification pics~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/a/platinum-3776-century-chartres-blue-dA9moYE)~~.  Condition: A2 (inked twice).  The nib is stamped M, but it writes F.~~  *~~Really~~* ~~F--as in compare the writing sample line width to the line width of the unflexed Pilot Metal Falcon SF.  Comes in original box.  My missing the pen's return window is your treasure.~~  **~~$110~~** **SOLD** All sellers and buyers must use PayPal Goods and Services as the method of payment.

I have finished my masters and realized that I have my grail pens that I use every once in a while. All my others have been in a binder for over a year now. I have also decided to add some bonus add ons to every purchase. These bonuses are 4 lamys in a variety of colors and nibs, as well as an extra TWSBI Fine Nib (this will be paired with either the clear or punch pink. They will all be selected at random.

Since they have been sitting for a little while, I did a quick clean but another cleaning will be needed on your end. Due to a recent move, I cannot find their boxes,. All pens will be package securely with a ton of bubble wrap, and again NONE HAVE BOXES.

[WTB] Pilot Vanishing Point <F> in matte blue/black;"For years I've ignored the VP, thinking it looked weird and wondering why I would ever want a fountain pen that didn't have a big nib. But then on a whim I ordered a Jinhao 10 and used it and fell in love. It is absolutely perfect for using when I am at work and am in too much of a hurry to unscrew a cap, such as when I'm taking notes on a phone call. So now that I see I like it, I figure upgrading to the real deal and with a gold nib is in order. 

Looking through the past pen swap entries, I see many of these have gone second hand for around $100. So just a shot in the dark here... does anyone have a blue matte version that they'd be willing to let go for around that? If not, I'll just pay the $176 for a new one, but I thought I'd check here first. 

I'd be willing to consider other colors, but that blue matte one does call out to me.

Pm PM If i weren't destashing I'd have to jump on that sailor black. Alas I've gone to the flex vintage dark side. But that ion plated nib is said to be springy(without even trying to be a flex) unlike the usual HM nail. The metal grip section is really ergonomic apparently.

**~~Pilot Vanishing Point LS Black Matte \[A2\]~~** ~~<F> - $250 - Comes with CON-40 and box - basically silent clicking mechanism, very easy to use one-handed.~~

These pens are some grails that are beautiful aesthetically and while writing:

**~~Pilot Custom Urushi Black~~** ~~\[A2\] <FM> - $550 ‚Äì Comes with CON-70 and box ‚Äì Massive, stunning #30 size nib. It is a really unique writing experience. The nib is soft and extremely smooth despite being a fine-medium nib, while the pen itself is actually very comfortable to hold because of the girth and the warm feeling of Urushi. The pen is massive tho, you might also want to purchase the Aegean Leather pen case I have below to hold it, since it‚Äôs too big for most other pen cases~~

**~~Montblanc 149~~** ~~\[B\] <M>  - $500 ‚Äì It writes smoothly like you would expect such an expensive pen to write, but with a unique feedback that is hard to describe. Like the Custom Urushi, its width makes it very comfortable to hold and write for long periods~~

**~~Pilot Vanishing Point Raden Water Surface~~** ~~\[A2\] <M> - $450 ‚Äì Comes with CON-40 and both wooden and cardboard box that Pilot sends the seller -. Urushi and raden. It is absolutely gorgeous in person in a way that is hard to capture in photos~~

**~~Visconti Homo Sapiens Dark Age~~** ~~\[B\] <B> - $450 ‚Äì Comes with another Visconti box - It‚Äôs a Visconti bucks the trend by writing narrower than you would expect (more like a medium) and by actually not having QC issues. The Homo Sapiens are my favorite writers and I would keep this one except for the fact that I already have another one.~~

I also have some Vanishing Points for sale, both with really special mechanisms! If you need a pen that is quick to deploy while being very quiet, either one is a good pick

**~~PENDING Pilot Vanishing Point Capless Fermo~~** ~~\[A2\] <F> - $80 - Comes with CON-40 and box - note: the nib is finicky, I am too afraid to try and fix it, so I‚Äôve given a discount on this one. But otherwise, a really nifty twist deployment mechanism that is fun to play with! Also the sticker is still on the pen if that matters to you~~

I also have:

**~~Lamy 2000 Black Makrolon~~** ~~\[A2\] <M> - $120 ‚Äì comes with the metal box - it do be a Lamy 2000~~

Both have been lightly written with.

I'm particularly looking at SE, wood, raden, blue or green carbonesque, or various LEs. Not interested in Decimo models. Stub nibs preffered but any nib is acceptable.

Send me a message if you think you have something I might be interested in. I can buy it, or if you'd prefer a trade, I can trade the pens on this listing or some others if you message me.

[WTS] Pilot Vanishing Point - Black/Gold [B];"Verification, Pics, Writing Sample: https://imgur.com/a/4JoXNMU

1999 Vintage VP bought at pen show - I originally bought it because I thought it would be good to put in my shirt pocket at work but it‚Äôs too heavy for me and unfortunately the grip is slightly uncomfortable. Looking to rehome this lovely pen to someone who can better appreciate it.

[B] for signs of use - minor scratches on the barrel and clicker, nothing distracting and I tried to make it evident in the photos what the quality looks like.

Asking $180 (+Shipping CONUS)

Paypal G&S only. Please comment down below and PM if you have any questions!
