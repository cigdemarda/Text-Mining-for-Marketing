1749061575-4,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"This says it's for manga or calligraphy, but that's not quite true.  The problem is that while you can vary the line thickness with this pen brush, you cannot do much to change the intensity, it's going to be dark.  Calligraphy depends on a uniform darkness, you use different brushes to vary the thickness of the characters.  Writing Kanji uses a stroke order and three basic types of strokes, a sweep where the line tapers to a sharp end, a stop where the line comes to an abrupt end, and a bounce where the line sort of check marks again to a sharp end.  Calligraphy angles and tilts the brush to accomplish these, each component is a continuous stroke without lifting the brush.  This tip does a nice job is practicing your small character writing for Japanese, and maybe Chinese as well.

I bought a couple of workbooks, one for Katakana, one for Hiragana, to practice the various Japanese alphabets.  I found this worked way better for creating the characters than a normal pen or pencil.  It helped me to practice the stroke order and reinforced why a stroke order is used.  As for other uses of this pen, you could actually do a fair job of caricatures. Many years ago I worked with a guy who was known as the Phantom, he did fantastic caricatures of people who worked for the power company.  Some of these were not flattering to management, besides being good, they were mostly black line, no shading for filling, but made their point.  This pen would be ideal for that type of drawing, but things with more detail or shading not so much.

Recommended for practicing or writing Chinese or Japanese characters at least in the small size.  If you really want to do calligraphy, they use a special paper and much larger brushes for thick bold strokes.  Still if you master the smaller versions, the larger sized characters will be easier to do.",,
1749061575-5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"So I was experimenting for a pen to use with study sessions and classes. I was looking for a pen that has a nice stream of rich black ink where it could be easily read, without it bleeding through the paper, writes smoothly with little resistance/pressure needed, and affordability/ durability.

  I wasn’t looking for a luxury pen cuz i got enough of those, i wanted something more ergonomic. I found that that felt pens fit my needs most and remembered a few videos of American professors and mathematicians talking about how fantastic the pencils and chalk from Japan is and how they’re superior. So i took their word and that’s how I ended up here!

  What i have to say is it’s definitely one of the smoothest writing pens with a wonderfully rich black ink that doesn’t bleed and just flows naturally when jotting down notes in a lecture and general studying. The few things Ill have to say is that highlighters don’t pair well with the pen cuz the black ink stain the marker itself, thus darkening the highlights, and it lasted me almost 2 months of intense college courses and studying. It also isn’t quite a practical pen you would carry around in your daily life.

1749061575-8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,I love this pen for quick sketches.  I can easily get very thin lines for details or thicker lines to quickly cover larger areas.

1749061575-9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"I'm learning to write Chinese and Japanese characters / calligraphy and it was suggested to me that a brush / fude pen would be more convenient than traditional brushes / ink (or even water brushes with a special water pad).

Checking out fude / brush pen reviews, it became clear that different pens are designed for different applications.  E.g., a brush pen which is great for Manga drawing is not necessarily the best for Chinese / Japanese Characters.  And one which was good for European calligraphy is typically not ideal for shading. And so on and so forth.  So understand what you want to do with a brush pen and do research before you buy!

Also, some brush pens actually used brushes (whether natural or synthetic bristles) as the tip, while others, like this one, uses a felt tip.

  http://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-choosing-a-brush-pen-for-calligraphy/pt/621

This Kuretake Bimori Felt Tip Brush is a good pen for Chinese / Japanese character art writing for beginners, as it is easy to control.  But since the actual change in line thickness from heavy to light pressure is limited, it is NOT the right brush pen for advanced artistic calligraphy and/or more advanced practitioners of the art of Chinese / Japanese calligraphy.

NOTE:  Another reviewer pointed out that hers did not leave clean lines.  Perhaps the one she received was a bit dried out.  The lines left by mine were quite clean, dark and solid.  But again:  this is a pen probably best for Chinese / Japanese characters rather than European Calligraphy or Manga Drawing.  In Chinese / Japanese characters, skipping & streaking is considered part of the art.  E.g., properly done, it adds to the beauty of the character.",,
1749061575-10,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"I received one of these as a gift and loved it so much I ordered more. They're great for sketching with a range of line weight and take marker fairly well, so long as you let them dry for a bit. They're also so inexpensive that I'm not shy about using them to doodle.

I only wish this store carried them in ""fine"" and not just ""super fine"", as I've found that to be the most versatile size. If you buy different sizes I'd recommend colour-coding them with some tape or something - if you don't read Japanese it'll be easier to distinguish them at a glance.",,

1749061575-41,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"I bought this pen as a tool to use during the month long inking project inktober. At first I really loved the feel of the grip and over all the length and balance were nice for doing my work. After about a week or so I started having issues with the lines I produced with this pen. The nib feels like a hard felt and initially had some nice spring to it allowing me to make nice dynamic lines that varied in weight. After a bit of use it feels like the tip has split so I no longer get a single clean line when I add pressure but I get an awkward uneven split line. I've never had this problem with an other inking pen and I have a lot of inking pens. I also really dislike that you can't put the cap on end of the pen when you're working. Part of the convenience of inking pens vs pot of ink is portablity. I always worry the clear cap is going to just disappear.

Overall this pen was disappointing. I loved the look and feel but the nib just didn't stand up to use well compared to other brushes I've had for a year or two, and that only in the three months I've had this with kind of light use. That cap also has nowhere to put it making this more of a bother with travel sketches. It's ok but you're better off getting a different inking pen for your money.",,
1749061575-42,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"Pros:
- trains your handwriting (even if you're not interested in calligraphy, practicing with a pressure-sensitive brush pen like this that allows for variable line widths will show you what motions you're doing wrong)
- doesn't bleed through thin workbook paper
- comfortable to hold and doesn't get your hand inky
- dark black ink
- made weekly Chinese homework (writing about 40 new characters 30-50 times each) fun

Cons:
- cap doesn't attach securely to the back of the pen (because of the loop) so it's easy to lose while writing
- tip starts to get smushed fairly quickly",,
1749061575-43,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"I like to use superfine brush pens for practicing kanji as they allow to write even complex characters with many strokes and still keep them small.

The pen allows to create strokes of different, including variable, width. However, one should be careful with a writing/drawing technique as the tip can lose its form and become wider if one applies too much pressure.

The pen glides smoothly and creates dark black well-defined strokes. But when the ink is close to exhaustion this pen produces strokes that look somewhat similar to dry brush technique. In a way it broadens the possible uses of the pen.

I also like how comfortable it is grip-wise. The body of the pen has approximately the same diameter as traditional Chinese and Japanese brushes of medium size (about 8-9mm). There is  a rubber band ear the tip end of the end, which prevents slips and rotation.

Overall I am pretty happy with this product. Although, the price could be lower since it is a disposable pen.",,

1749061575-125,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"The ink of the pen flows nicely, and does not actually bleed through the paper unreasonably. I do admit, I am scared to apply as much pressure as I would like to practice some calligraphy, and so I am not reviewing it for that.

If I were reviewing this for something it is not, a brush pen, it would obviously be a 3-star-review, because nothing can really replicate a brush, but I am reviewing this as a felt-tipped pen and a ball-tipped-pen, and it is nice!

The pen cap is clear and doubles as an okay-stand, so the brush can be set vertically, and brush can even be hung due to a cord on the bottom. If you are a person who likes putting the cap on the bottom of the pen for writing, the cap can even do that.

I tested this pen on three surfaces I usually write on, which are off-brand graph paper, off-brand 3x5"" note cards, and off-brand loose-leaf-notebook-paper, and of these all, the notebook paper is where it shewed--smoothness and ink transfer at a quick-pace. I normally prefer writing on notecards due to their sturdiness and smooth writing surface, but, unlike a ballpoint, this pen had a lot of drag on the notecard and honestly would be good if one writes slowly on the notecard, say for flash cards, and I do say, I enjoyed writing slowly on a note card with it.",,
1749061575-126,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00313J7JS/,"I own many different fude brush pens for drawing and calligraphy (western, not Japanese). This series by Kuretake is one of my favorites. The tip is flexible enough for easy stroke variation, but firm enough to make consistent hairlines when needed. The ink delivery is perfectly calibrated to the speed and pressure of your hand movements -- juicy when needed, light and airy when going in for tiny strokes. And unlike a lot of hard-tipped fude pens, there's very little scratchiness when using the side of the nib for broader lines. I really enjoy working with this one.",,

(que por cierto, os recomiendo que probéis esta actividad alguna vez, despeja la cabeza mejor que cualquier psicólogo). Bueno, al lío, el entintador responde muy bien a la presión e inclinación, pudiendo jugar con ello y poder así realizar trazos desde muy finos hasta relativamente gruesos y también realizar esas lineas de fino a grueso típicas del lettering, y a mi tanto me gustan para dibujar. En mano me resulta cómodo y agradable.  Es un poco carillo, pero de vez en cuando salen ofertas por debajo de 5 euros que tampoco es tanto, ya que dura bastante. En definitiva, el ""Kuretake Bimoji"" es uno de mis entintadores preferidos.",,
